I've been doing the same thing.

Right now in bcachefs-tools we've got two different crates, one for
bcachefs rust code proper and another for bindings, with a build.rs for
bindgen.

Any pointers to how we'll be interacting with bindgen kernel side? We
need to pass it some stuff, see
https://evilpiepirate.org/git/bcachefs-tools.git/tree/rust-src/bch_bindgen/build.rs

Can't wait... :)
