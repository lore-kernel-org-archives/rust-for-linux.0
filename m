Yes, I agree. The limitation is by design. My point is, `vm_insert_page`
can work fine with the `&ARef<Page>` type. So if that would be OK with
you, I would patch that as part of this patch.

As far as I can tell, we can also switch `Owned<Page>` to allocate the
page with `__GFP_COMP` and use `put_page` in drop.

This is not the use case `Ownable` aims to solve.

I am wondering if we can make case I intend to solve (Ownable is a
unique reference) coexist with the "at most one of this ref can exist".
The "at most one of this kind" sounds similar to the `ListArc` use case
to me, which is a different problem.
