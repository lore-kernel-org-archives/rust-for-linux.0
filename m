Fair enough. :)

That's what happens here as well, see below.

Yes, the driver has this opportunity, again see below.

There is no second memory allocation. In the implementation of
fwctl::Device::new() above we call _fwctl_alloc_device() with a size (and
layout) such that this allocation is suitable to initialize the second argu=
ment
(i.e. data: impl PinInit<T, Error>) within this allocation.

This is the equivalent to the subclassing pattern as you would implement it=
 in C
with container_of(). See also the drm::Device implementation [1], which doe=
s the
exact same thing.

When it comes to the Registration object (which returns an initializer as w=
ell),
this would go into the initializer (initializer can be nested) of the drive=
r's
device private data of the parent device, i.e. no separate allocation, it j=
ust
lives in the driver's device private data of the parent device.

Alternatively, we can also just not return a Registration object at all and
leave it up to devres to entirely, i.e. equivalent to a
devm_fwctl_register_device() function. The Registration object is only need=
ed if
we intend to unregister the fwctl device before the parent device unbind.
