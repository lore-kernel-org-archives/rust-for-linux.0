I can't find below a paragraph that seems related to this, hence I reply here.

The above is just different wording for: A driver is typically registered in
module_init() and unregistered in module_exit().

Isn't that what happens normally?

Yes, I agree it's more precise to say that this should be implemented by a bus
(e.g. PCI). I can reword this one.

I think it's really about perspective. Generally speaking, when a driver is
registered it gets added to a bus through bus_add_driver(). Now, one could argue
that the "register" operation is a bus operation, since something gets
registered on the bus, but one could also argue that it's a driver operation,
since a driver is registered on something.

Consequently, I think it's neither wrong to call this one `BusOps` nor is it
wrong to call it `DriverOps`.

I still think `DriverOps` is more appropriate, since here we're looking at it
from the perspective of the driver.

In the end we call it as `driver.register()` instead of `bus.register()`. For
instance, in the PCI implementation of it, we call __pci_register_driver() from
`DriverOps::register`.

A bus specific trait would not add any value. The whole point if a trait is to
represent a generic interface. It basically describes the functionality we
expect from a certain category of types.

In this case we know that every driver can be registered and unregistered, hence
we can define a generic trait that every bus specific driver structure, e.g. PCI
driver, has to implement.

With the above tait (or interface) we now can have a generic `Registration` that
calls `T::register` and `T::unregister` and works for all driver types (PCI,
platform, etc.). Otherwise we'd need a `pci::Registration`, a
`platform::Registration` etc. and copy-paste the below code for all of them.

We are registering a driver on bus here, see the below `T::register` call, this
one ends up in __pci_register_driver() or __platform_driver_register(), etc. Hence
we need the module and the module name.

Please see the first patch of the series for an explanation why THIS_MODULE and
KBUILD_MODNAME is not in scope here and why we need to pass this through.

Honestly, even though it seems to be complicated, this is in fact the simple
way. This really is the minimum we can do to register a driver and get it
probed.

Please also consider that all the abstractions I am submitting in this series
are only making use of APIs that regular C drivers use as well. This series
doesn't touch internals of any subsystem.

Hence, we know the model very well. It's the same as in C, we're just
abstracting it into common Rust design patterns.

The only exception might be passing through the module name, but this is just
the consequence of the design and necessity that already has been discussed and
was merged.
