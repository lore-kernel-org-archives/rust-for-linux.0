kdump does not work on Apple ARM systems because kexec is broken and
cannot be fully fixed, due to multiple platform/firmware limitations. A
very limited version of kexec might work well enough for kdump, but I
don't think anyone has looked into making that work yet...

Devcoredump just makes the dump available via /sys so it can be
collected by the user. The system is still alive, the GPU is just dead
and all future GPU job submissions fail. You can still SSH in or (at
least in theory, if enough moving parts are graceful about it) VT-switch
to a TTY. The display controller is not part of the GPU, it is separate
hardware.
