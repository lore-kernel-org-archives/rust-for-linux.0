Going out of my area of expertise... So take the following with a pinch
of salt.

Yes to userspace provided nonce. My understanding is that can come
from the verifier that wants to ensure freshness.

I'm not sure exactly what our security model is in the native CMA case,
so what software we can trust on the host. I.e. does the DH session actually
need to be between the kernel and the peer?

We have a small amount of context (8 bytes) that we can put anything as
part of challenge/auth (alongside the nonce) It will part of the signed
response. Would that work for something from with the CSPRNG,
mixed so that you can't go from that context to the CSPRNG value?

Agreed. Very interesting to know what exactly is going in the TSM
SPDM exchanges as hopefully that will reflect best practice. If we
are really lucky they won't all do different things ;)
