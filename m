Yes, apologies for not clarifying it. I meant exactly that: the code
would stop compiling if either the target was dropped for any reason,
or supporting AArch64 BE would hold back upgrading the compiler for
other architectures. Though, this is from a very high level overview.
If you feel like this won't be an issue, I don't have any problems
with this :)

Yes, I appear to have missed copying the `In-Reply-To` header in this
reply thread. Sorry about that.
