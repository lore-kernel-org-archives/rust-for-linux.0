Ah. I was missing what you wanted with the DH part. For some reason wasn't
thinking about IDE (maybe because this patch set doesn't get you there for
native). Though as I understand it some of the native usecases for CMA aren't
using link encryption (different security model from CoCo).

Yes, if you want to avoid MIM you need to bring up IDE etc - the basic fact
that both ends can still talk to each other after enabling it given they have
to have the same keys and those went over the secure channel, is part of the
security around that. I think you can attest before that point and rely on
the link 'failing' if there was a man in the middle. The verifier would
want the evidence IDE was up before giving you any secrets.

Whether anyone actually implements root ports via standard DOE flows or
everyone does this a custom way at the host is an open question.
There are various mix and match situations where the Coco / TSM flows
mean we have an encrypted channel, but we are doing our own native
attestation (to a different DOE, say on a VF).  Anyhow, others on this thread
have more info (I think) on the corner cases of how this is going to be
used than I do.

The secure channel establishment and key exchange comes later in the SPDM
flow than this patch set currently covers. This bit just gets you to the
point where you know you are ultimately talking to right device - you don't
know there isn't a MIM at this point.

Next up is KEY_EXCHANGE / KEY_EXCHANGE_RSP / FINISH / FINISH_RSP that will
exchange the public ephemeral keys and ultimately get us a secure channel.
Then we then switch to secured-CMA which is the PCIe spec and is basically the
format for wrapping up the session IDs etc + the encrypted channel.
Lukas' github has the next few bits required, but not sure he's all the
way there yet?

That then gets used for key exchange messages related to IDE via the PCI
spec defined IDE_KM protocol. (which is fairly simple compared to the other
steps - only about 8 pages :)).

So we may need to get a bit further before we can do the attestation
flow that would be equivalent to what CoCo needs.  I'm thinking
we may need one more set of measurements to verify both ends think
IDE is up.

For now the host will know it didn't bring up IDE.

For SPDM it's this or pre shared key stuff which requires some out of
band way path. So probably ignore that.

Agreed, that's my basic undestanding as well and likewise, can get
some appropriate folk to check it out once we have the full thing described.
