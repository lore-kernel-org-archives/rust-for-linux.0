I actually agree to some extent. But I do think we can get around most
confusion with loud and clear documentation. We could make the driver
not probe by default, requiring a configfs setting to probe. Or leave
the PCI identifier table empty, so patching the driver is required to
make it probe.

For me, the big benefit would be having the rust nvme driver as part of
an allmodconfig or allyesconfig. That would prevent a ton of trouble.

We do plan to utilize the block infrastructure, but I think we are still
quite a long way from sending anything. Keeping the rust nvme driver in
tree till that point would prevent pci, dma, irq, etc. from developing
in ways that would not support a block device use case. As an example,
upstream Rust irq APIs are not actually able to support NVMe at the
moment. They work fine for GPU drivers though. And I cannot go an fix
them without a user. Same for DMA pool.

I could go and find some other piece of unsupported PCI hardware and
write a driver for that, use that to keep the APIs in shape upstream.
It's just a lot more work and the NVMe driver is already here and 90%
ready.

Or we can fix the APIs at a later point, when we have a user for them
that is not a duplicated reference driver. My fear is that by then, I
have to patch a number of GPU drivers in the process.
