Can you expand a bit on why you think r/w semaphores are not the answer? =
They
seem to correctly encode the logic we want.

We don't want to "come back=E2=80=9D, anything that is in-flight must =
complete, i.e.:
the reset logic must wait for in-flight jobs, because the work has =
already been
dispatched to the hardware. We do want to forbid more work from being =
queued
while a reset is pending, though.

What about all resources associated with this class device? Userspace =
would be
holding handles to resources that are effectively gone.


In any case, I'm not trying to push this r/w semaphore thing as "the =
right
thing", and if the "srcu + counter" idea turns out to be better, great! =
:)

The problem is what Boris said recently, though: there's a delay between =
the
point of "we need a reset" and the reset worker being scheduled.

In the design I proposed, there would be a window of time in which:

1) the hardware is in an invalid state, and must be reset
2) the reset worker hasn't run yet, so the "write" lock has not been =
taken
3) due to 2, the submit() logic sees the hardware as available, and =
queues more work
4) the work from 3 now gets to execute even though the hardware is =
crashed
