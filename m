On Mali, the hardware syncobj starts at 0. If you see a 0, is this the =
default
state, or should you signal seqno 0?

This problem goes away if we can have seqnos starting at a custom value, =
like
1. It seems like the C machinery also special-cases 0 in a few other =
places too.

Agree about the fail-free part.

The problem I see here is that new_fence() will use "seqno" and "nr" =
from
whatever context called new_fence(), but DriverFenceAllocation has some =
other
(possibly unrelated) context as its DriverFenceData::fctx.

The lifetimes are apparently broken too, because 'a is the lifetime of =
the
context where new_fence_allocation was called, meaning that the context =
that
actually called new_fence() can drop, even though it provided the state =
for
dma_fence_init().

I guess this can be solved by moving new_fence() to impl =
DriverFenceAllocation?
That already has a context, and most importantly, the right context.

No, variable names are fine IMHO. It=E2=80=99s only types where I think =

Is the information that a callback was called more important than the =
fact that
it was called because a fence was signaled? I think that a driver author =
would
rather implement =E2=80=9Cwhat happens when the fence is signaled=E2=80=9D=
 versus
=E2=80=9Cwhat happens when the callback is called=E2=80=9D. But this is =
pretty minor.
If you still think that called is better, I don=E2=80=99t object either =
:)

For example, you say =E2=80=9Ca Fence cannot be signaled=E2=80=9D. A =
person seeing this
code for the first time might ask why. Specially if they start by =
reading the
docs for Fence first.

I think explaining a bit more about the DriverFence/Fence/refcounting as =
you
said is already enough to settle it.

I see, there is a lot more context on this then. Can you merely add a =
comment
saying it=E2=80=99s ok to call dma_fence_is_signaled() without the =

Actually, when I first made this comment, I think pointers were being =

Back then I wanted one type to deref to *const and the other one to =
deref to
*mut. This does not seem to be the case anymore, so please forget what I =
