This implies that there really is no "need" for these rust bindings at
all, if you don't know of, or are planning for, any real driver for
them.  So why have them at all?

For the PCI and driver core bindings, and the majority of the other ones
merged, we have real users (binder, nova-core, etc.) and so we are
willing to take them and keep them up to date.  For these block
bindings, why is it even worth it to have them around if there's never
going to be a real user?
