The signaled bit is set under lock-protection, fully ordered. Reading
is just racing. See my other patch series, I linked two bugs that could
have been avoided if it were ordered.

Anyways, I was just answering your point. These functions' parallelism
is unchanged.

No, it isn't. It makes the API fragile.

	commit c8a5d5ea3ba6 ("nouveau: fix client work fence deletion race")
	commit 7c703a7d3f2b ("drm/amdgpu: Fix one use-after-free of VM")

There are certainly more related bugs around.

Also think of the various ordering issues between signaled-bit and ops
pointer that you and I observed.

Locks are for mutual exclusion. Which is what you want here: you want
to exclude someone from signaling the fence while you are working on
it.

Tell me one thing:
If locking is the wrong approach, then how come it was added to
literally all callbacks except for set_deadline()? Seems to me that it
must have solved some issues.

Of course the framework needs to specify exactly what the callbacks are
about and what the driver should do in them. That's btw why many expect
Rust to result in often better driver design, because by the type
system you can define how your API can and cannot be used.

That's like saying it's perfectly possible that someone will want to
allocate memory in a callback. Yet we say No, you cannot do that.

dma_fence_signal() you mean?

I don't get your point. What you wish to happen is already the case:

dma_fence_is_signaled(struct dma_fence *fence)
{
	const struct dma_fence_ops *ops;

	if (dma_fence_test_signaled_flag(fence))
		return true;

	rcu_read_lock();
	ops =3D rcu_dereference(fence->ops);
	if (ops && ops->signaled && ops->signaled(fence)) {
		rcu_read_unlock();
		dma_fence_signal(fence);

I don't see that either. In the interrupt you will want to do:

driver_lock();
seqno =3D get_seqno();
driver_unlock();

signal_fences_up_to(seqno);

Right now, we do both: call callbacks with a lock *and* force all API
users to do the RCU dance.

So we have the worst of both worlds.

AFAICS amdgpu only uses ops->enable_signaling(), and there it does
exactly what I would have expected: register a timer who will see the
fence gets signaled.

As I said, no reason to do list accesses like nouveau. That's just the
driver being misdesigned.

Interestingly btw amdgpu's ops->release() does a call_rcu() to free the
fence.

You do agree with me that our API being usable like this:

dma_fence_signal(f, err);
dma_fence_put(f);

would be robust and desirable, don't you?

>=20

Calling a callback while holding a lock is not leaking the lock. It's
sometimes necessary. All fence callbacks are being called under lock
protection, for the same reason as I propose here: prevent the fence's
state from changing while they execute.
