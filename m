Thanks very much, Nicolás.

I've had a closer look at the new version of this, and have a few 
comments. Ultimately, I think a mix of this version and the original RFC 
is probably best, and in particular, using a panic_handler instead of 
modifying kunit_try_catch, and removing the special-case assert!() 
handling would be ideal.

I think if we only handle Rust panics, this should go away, right?

Yes, the issue in [4] (that tests exiting early is unsafe) is known and 
kind-of unfixable. It does mean that we'd want to avoid deliberately 
panic-ing if we at all can.

It's possible to avoid resource leaks by using the KUnit resource / 
defer functionality, but that's not readily exposed in Rust at the 
moment (and it's likely to be highly non-idiomatic).

I like this, but if we're calling it 'rust_should_panic', it should only 
affect Rust panics.

Ultimately, I think that we probably want to restrict #[should_panic] to 
Rust panics at this stage, so using #[panic_handler] would work best.

This greatly simplifies the implementation, and makes it much more targeted.

If we do really want to support panics from C, then I think we want to 
build this on top of the warning suppression feature[1], and expose it 
from C as well as Rust. It only traps WARN(), rather than BUG(), though.

I think rust_should_panic as an attribute is good, but it should just be 
checked from a panic_handler. If it supports more than just rust panics, 
it probably shouldn't be called *rust_*should_panic (and again, should 
probably be based on the warning suppression instead).

This is great, thanks!
