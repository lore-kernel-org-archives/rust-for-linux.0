I made a script to compare the size and alignment of bcachefs structs
in C vs. in Rust generated by the patched, lossy bindgen. All sizes
were the same, but the following types had different alignment:

bkey			(8 in C, 4 in Rust)
bch_extent_crc32	(8 in C, 4 in Rust)
bch_extent_ptr		(8 in C, 1 in Rust)

I didn't explicitly compare the offsets of all struct members between
Rust and C as I couldn't come up with a trivial way to automate this.
However, I think that if the C struct is packed, and the Rust and C
structs have the same size, you can conclude that all member offsets
are the same. This is because Rust could not increase the offset of a
member (or else the Rust size would be larger), it could not decrease
the offset of a member (because it's already packed), and it could not
reorder the members (because #[repr(C)] prohibits this in Rust).

Given the above logic, I think it's safe to conclude that if a struct
is packed in C, and the size and alignment are the same between C and
Rust, then they are fully ABI compatible. Does anyone see an error in
my reasoning?


Taking a look at struct bkey, the alignment difference arises from a
semantic difference between gcc's __attribute__((packed, aligned(N)))
and rustc's #[repr(C, packed(N))]. In Rust,

We can get the same alignment for struct bkey in Rust by modifying
the code from bindgen to use align(8) instead of packed(8). On my
x86_64 Linux system, this results in a struct with the same size,
alignment, and offsets of all members as the original C struct. This
works because the struct happens to be packed already, so the
#[repr(packed)] attribute is superfluous. I can't say if this works in
any other environment with different architecture, endianness, etc. But
introducing an automated test for comparing the size and alignment of
bindgen-generated structs could help with validating other environments.


In general, given a C structure like

struct A {
	...
} __packed __aligned(N);

I think a Rust structure can be created with the same size, alignment,
and member offsets in the following cases: 

(1) #[repr(packed(N))] will have the same layout if N is <= the
    structure's default alignment and all members with a default
    alignment >= N naturally have an offset that is a multiple of N.
    Also, no member can have an alignment attribute as rustc forbids
    this [2].

(2) #[repr(align(N))] will have the same layout if the structure's size
    without the packed attribute is equal to the sum of the size of all
    its members (i.e., it is "naturally packed"), and the structure's
    default alignment is <= N.

(I haven't formally proven these rules and I welcome counterexamples if
someone can spot an error in my logic.)

An example of a struct that I think the current rustc cannot represent:

struct rust_cannot_represent_this {
	u8 a;
	u32 b;
} __packed __aligned(2);

Luckily, I do not think bcachefs has any structs like this.


TL;DR -- even without a rustc fix to support packed and aligned structs,
I think it is possible in many cases to create Rust structs with the
same memory layout, although it may take some manual effort. Perhaps
bindgen could be enhanced with awareness of rule (2) from above, to
automatically cover more cases than it does now?

Of course, a fix to rustc is the best option. It would avoid the need
for error-prone manual work. Specifying both #[repr(packed, align(N))]
also communicates semantic intent more than specifying just one even
when the result is the same. But we could be waiting a while for that
fix to arrive.
