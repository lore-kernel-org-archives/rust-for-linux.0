A typical kernel build consists of a frustratingly large amount of time
spent stuck in single-threaded bottlenecks.

It turns out that there's a lot we can do about this and doing so
significantly impacts kernel build times.

This series makes allmodconfig builds up to 36% faster, incremental builds
up to ~70% faster, and noop builds up to ~90% faster.

Builds are faster across the board on every device I tested.

Machines used for perf testing:

* Threadripper -   x86, AMD Threadripper 9980X, 64 cores, 128 threads
* EPYC         -   x86, 2 socket EPYC 9754, 256 cores, 512 threads
* M2           - arm64, 2022 M2 macbook pro, 8 cores, 8 threads
                        (4 perf, 4 efficiency)

Cutting to the chase:

		== IMPORTANT NOTE on dependencies/build configuration ==

Performance numbers are based on a build which:

* Is based on v7.4-rc1, which contains the first 11 patches of v4 (see
  the Patches section).
* Was measured with these series applied (neither are required, but do
  shift the numbers by a few seconds):
	https://lore.kernel.org/linux-modules/20260731-module_ver_remove-v2-0-c9163858f382@linuxfoundation.org/
	https://lore.kernel.org/all/cover.1788899473.git.jpoimboe@kernel.org/
* Runs `make KRUSTFLAGS=-Zthreads=8 -j $(nproc) ...`.
* Runs with the pigz tool installed locally.

			== Testing ==

Beyond x86, allmodconfig was built with the series for arm64, arm, riscv,
powerpc64, s390 and loongarch, and for arm64, arm, s390 and loongarch the
System.map is identical to what the previous shell mksysmap produces for
the same vmlinux.

Also tested were parisc64 and m68k build as far as mainline lets them
(a driver's static assertion and an undefined-symbol check on parisc, gcc
16 internal compiler errors on m68k, none of it from this series).

Kernels for x86, arm64, arm, riscv, loongarch, powerpc64, s390, m68k and
parisc64 all boot under qemu, every text symbol of System.map is in
/proc/kallsyms at the relocated address, and a module loads and unloads.
The s390, arm and loongarch kernels also pass the kallsyms selftest.

An x86 kernel with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS, CONFIG_EXTENDED_MODVERSIONS and
CONFIG_MODULE_SRCVERSION_ALL boots, loads and unloads modules. External
modules build against both in-tree and O= builds, and every commit builds
on x86 defconfig.

Build times are the best of several runs, no unexpected errors or
warnings were seen.

While some aspects of the build process have been changed, all tooling
should function identically to before.

			== LLM usage ==

An LLM was used to first determine where the bottlenecks were then to
figure out how to improve them.

It generated a lot of code, much of it hideous.

I extensively audited and rewrote a lot of it, and heavily edited commit
messages, the cover letter and comments.

The LLM has also orchestrated build runs, testing, debugging and analysis.

I have manually checked for correctness in both build and running kernels
generated with this series applied.

Performance improvements were also verified manually.

Since an LLM was used extensively, each commit carries an Assisted-by tag.

			== What was changed? ==

Fundamentally the series improves build times by parallelising
single-threaded tasks as much as possible and improving the efficiency of
code used in the build process.

kbuild, kallsyms, modpost, objtool, mksysmap and the rust build system were
all updated as part of this change.

Nothing too controversial was included. There are further improvements that
could be made, but they would either by very invasive (large scale C header
changes) or generate diminishing returns.

                        == Patches ==

Patches marked [upstream] are already in v7.4-rc1.

   kbuild:           [upstream] Make .modinfo an INFO section.

   kallsyms:         [upstream] Some efficiency improvements through use of a
                     cache.

   sorttable:        [upstream] Parse nm output correctly, for the next patch.

   kbuild:           [upstream] Don't sort nm output unnecessarily, do not
                     include relocations in the kallsyms trial links.

   elf-parse:        [upstream] Section flags, symbol binding and a read-only
                     mapping, for the next patch.

   kallsyms:         [upstream] Don't use nm, read the ELF symbol table
                     directly.

   kbuild (1, 2):    Implement a cache to track objects, check dependency
                     timestamps more efficiently.

   kbuild:           [upstream] Move the toolchain checks into their own
                     Kconfig file.

   kbuild:           [upstream] Probe compiler, linker flags once at top of
                     build.

   modpost (3):      Improve performance through use of a cache.

   modules (4, 5):   Emit module descriptors as assembly (*.mod.S) rather
                     than C (*.mod.c), reducing CPU seconds taken by 10x to
                     perform the task. Also shard module finalisation
                     rather than running 10's of thousands of tiny runs.

   objtool (6-9):    Replace reloc hash with a per-section index, size
                     the instruction hash to the code rather than hard-code
                     it, and decode large objects over multiple threads.

   rust (10, 11):    Set correct dependencies and build crates in parallel
                     with C code, retaining the requirement that rust/
                     crates are built first.

   kbuild:           [upstream] Default to using a parallel implementation of
                     gzip (pigz) if available on the system.

---
v5:
* Rebased onto v7.4-rc1, which contains the cc-option-str series, so that
  is no longer a separate prerequisite.
* Dropped the first 11 patches of v4, taken by Nathan for 7.4-rc1.
* Dropped the Assisted-by: tags, as the kernel no longer uses them.
* Updated 3/11 (was 13/22) to keep the section mismatch cache in struct
  elf_info, alongside the existing symsearch cache, as per Petr.
* Updated 3/11 (was 13/22) to name the destination section index
  to_secndx in the cache helpers, as per Petr.
* Updated 3/11 (was 13/22) to take the elf_info first in
  get_section_mismatch() like the rest of modpost, as per Petr.
* Updated 4/11 (was 14/22) to fold the ksymtab string and flag emitters
  into add_asm_ksymtab(), as per Petr.
* Updated 4/11 (was 14/22) to inline export_is_kept() at its only call
  site, as per Petr.
* Updated 4/11 (was 14/22) to drop a const qualifier on a local, as per
  Petr.
* Updated 4/11 (was 14/22) so the extended version name loop uses
  skip_unversioned() rather than repeating its condition, as per Petr.
* Updated 4/11 (was 14/22) to shorten the module-offsets.c comment, as per
  Petr.
* Updated 4/11 (was 14/22) to remove the now unused MODULE_ARCH_INIT from
  include/linux/module.h and m68k, as per Petr.

v4:
* Added tags, thanks everybody!
* Fixed broken m2 numbers in cover letter as per Linus.
* Rebased onto 36d4a11b56aa as per Nathan, see
  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kbuild/linux.git/commit/?id=36d4a11b56aa
* Also rebased onto the cc-option-str series at
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-kbuild/20260919005923.i.879-kees@kernel.org/
  as per Kees (impacts 12/22).
* Updated cover letter to declare these dependencies.
* Updated 1/22 to use /dev/null for objcopy output file, as per Kees.
* Updated 1/22 so the .modinfo dump no longer picks up the arch's image
  OBJCOPYFLAGS, as per Nicolas.

* Updated 2/22 to Use ARRAY_SIZE() for token_profit iteration in
  find_best_token() as per Kees.
* Updated 2/22 to restore erroneously deleted comments as per Kees.
* Added 4/22, fixing an already-existing sorttable bug that didn't matter
  before but which the next patch can trigger in a problematic way, as
  vaguely kinda-reported by Sashiko (incorrect analysis, but right to query
  sorttable).
* Updated 6/22 to add a comment noting that --emit-relocs comes from
  link-vmlinux.sh, as per Kees.
* Updated 7/22 to provide elf_open_ro()/elf_close() and struct elf_file, as
  per Kees.
* Updated 7/22 to also handle the section 0 overflow case (SHN_XINDEX, zero
  e_shnum) in elf_open_ro() matching what sorttable does.
* Updated 8/22 to lay out omit tables one entry per line, resurrecting
  comments from the old mksysmap script, as per Kees.
* Updated 8/22 to add sysmap_omit_patterns[] rather than open-coding, as
  per Kees.
* Updated 8/22 to check ferror() before closing System.map output,
  as per Kees.
* Updated 8/22 to grow the kallsyms table by doubling rather than in fixed
  steps, as per Kees.
* Updated 8/22 to use the elf_file helper in elf-parse rather than
  open-coding it, as per Kees.
* Updated 9/22 to reword the commit message to say the object state is
  calculated rather than cached, as per Kees + Nicolas.
* Updated 10/22 to zero depcheck's dependency entries on allocation, as per
  Kees.
* Updated 10/22 to never treat targets in the dependency list as fresh, so
  that objects including a header regenerated in the same make run are
  rebuilt in the same run, as per Kees.
* Updated 10/22 so depcheck is not run for a non-existent directory/one
  that doesn't have .cmd files. Came up in a private tree kernel robot run
  for sh allnoconfig, as per kernel robot.
* Updated 11/22 to put the toolchain Kconfig entries in
  scripts/Kconfig.toolchain as per Kees, Nathan + Nicolas.
* Updated 11/22 to add scripts/Kconfig.toolchain to the KCONFIG entry in
  MAINTAINERS.
* Updated 12/22 to use Kees's new [cc, ld]-option-str functionality as per
  Kees and Nathan.
* Updated 12/22 to check negative options using the positive form, as gcc
  accepts unknown -Wno-xxx options without complaint, only warning later in
  the build. Came up in a private tree kernel robot run for arc, parisc
  randconfig's. As per kernel robot.
* Updated 14/22 to emit each export's ksymtab entry and CRC in one walk, as
  per Petr.
* Updated 14/22 to fold extended version emitters into one function, as per
  Petr.
* Updated 14/22 to fold dependency collection into add_asm_depends(), as
  per Petr.
* Updated 14/22 to add a weak __this_module symbol to module-common.c so
  debug info continues to be provided for it, as per Petr.
* Updated 17/22 to split the DWARF skipping in objtool into its own commit,
  as per Josh.
* Updated 17/22 to index out-of-order relocations over a sorted order
  rather than doing a linear scan, as per Josh.
* Updated 19/22 to rebuild dropped relocation index under a lock as a
  belts+braces measure (contention shouldn't actually happen).
* Updated 21/22 to add rust as a dependency to rustdoc and rusttest, as per
  kernel robot.
* Updated 22/22 (was 20/20) to add pigz to scripts/ver_linux as per Manuel
  (and previously I think Kees suggested it also? :)

v3:
* Rebased on Linus's master branch.
* Fixed link to Josh's series, which was wrongly pointing at a single
  commit as per Andre (off-list).
* Fixed typo in 11/20 (+ fixed a couple more), as per John.
* Hardened depcheck in 9/20 against a .cmd file with an empty name as per
  Sashiko.
* Updated 14/20 so only the top-level make instance builds .module-common.o
  the chunk instances treat it as a plain prerequisite, to prevent a child
  accidentally building it as per Sashiko.
* Updated 15/20 to drop the relocation hash altogether, building one
  section at a time incrementally, falling back to linear scan for anything
  out of order (not sure that'll ever happen though?) as per Josh, Linus.
* Updated 17/20 to limit the parallelisation to the --link step only (in
  practice - objtool's processing of vmlinux.o) + updated commit msg to
  reflect, as per Kees.
* Updated the commit message in 14/20 to give clearer rationales for the
  batching of modfinal instances, as per Kees.
* Dropped what was 18/21 - the rustc front end threading patch, as the
  parallel flag name is still uncertain and a user can set
  KRUSTFLAGS=-Zthreads=8 to get the behaviour without it. Also updated
  cover letter pre-requisite section to mention this, as per Miguel.
* Updated 19/20 (was 20/21) so modules_prepare no longer builds rust/
  when a goal that builds the tree is also given, ensuring duplicate rust/
  builds do not happen, as per Kees.
* Updated 20/20 (was 21/21) to remove the reproducible build doc update,
  as per Kees.
* Updated 20/20 (was 21/21) to have pigz use the make job server and to
  define a specific kernel build variable for this - KPGZIP - also fold
  in a further suggestion which eliminates a wrapper script, as per Kees.
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260917-build-speedup-v3-0-9ecf4163ff36@kernel.org

v2:
* Rebased on Linus's master branch.
* Removed the first 2 fix patches as they have been taken to upstream in
  commit 281b61d408d4 ("scripts/mksysmap: drop the MODULE_INFO() symbols
  from kallsyms") and commit 59351365ac27 ("scripts/mksysmap: fix escape of
  '$' in the __pi_ pattern") - thanks Nicolas!
* Fixed patch 3/21 (previously 4/23) to check error on close via ferror()
  and fclose() as per David Laight.
* Updated 21/21 to not use threads for modules, only for vmlinux, and
  updated docs to reflect this.
* Dropped patches (as was) 13 and 17 as the equivalent work is being
  performed upstream:
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-modules/20260731-module_ver_remove-v2-0-c9163858f382@linuxfoundation.org/
* Updated the cover letter to mention the dependency on this series for
  perf numbers.
* Fixed various typos.
* Checked all of the hallucinated sashiko reports. Replied inline to emails
  to keep a record of them but not going to repeat here, unless people want
  a list.
* Fixed up 9/21 (was 11/23) to fix the bit of sashiko's report that wasn't
  hallucinated - check ferror() to bring depcheck in line with fixdep and
  kallsyms.
* Fixed up patch 13/21 (was 15/23) to emit the __this_module fields in
  offset order to handle CONFIG_RANDSTRUCT as per Sashiko.
* Fixed up patch 19/23 (now 17/21) to resolve various races. Sashiko
  hallucinated a lot of the report, and missed some stuff thread sanitizer
  found. Resolve call destinations serially to resolve most of the valid
  stuff and add a lock around pv_ops, and instruction hash freed
  properly. Tested and confirmed resolved locally, as per Sashiko.
* Fixed up patch 20/21 (was 22/23) to only build rust/ when modules_prepare
  is one of several make goals, rather than the only one. This matches the
  rest of the Makefile's behaviour on this and ensures rust components are
  built if multiple build choices are passed to make, as per Sashiko.
* Fixed up patch 5/21 (was 6/23) to test CONFIG_ARCH_VMLINUX_NEEDS_RELOCS
  directly in link-vmlinux.sh rather than plumbing a var through, for a far
  smaller patch as per Nathan.
* Moved patch 1/21 (was 9/23) to the front of the series and dropped two
  comments, as per Nathan, so it can go in ahead of the rest.
* Added patch 10/21 moving the existing toolchain checks out of
  init/Kconfig into init/Kconfig.toolchain, as per Nathan, with 11/21
  adding to it.
* In 11/21 (previously 12/23) Moved -fno-stack-clash-protection back to
  the Makefile to fix an issue with ppc32 as per Nathan.
* Updated patch 15/21 (was 18/23) to drop the dead end cache as Josh has
  one in his noreturn series:
  https://lore.kernel.org/9d4b8ccfed745ac47a954aa2e1de62a85197122d.1788899473.git.jpoimboe@kernel.org
* Also updated patch 15/21 (was 18/23) to hash relocation sections objtool
  creates itself and moved cache-to-hash copy into elf_create_reloc(), as
  per Josh.
* Split the instruction hash sizing out of patch 17/21 (was 19/23) into its
  own patch 16/21, as per Josh.
* Made the rustc parallel front end opt-in in patch 18/21 (was 20/23) via
  KBUILD_RUST_THREADS, as its output is not yet reproducible, and dropped
  the probe for the planned -j flag, as per Björn, Miguel and Nicolas.
* Tested changes to ensure any flagged issues were resolved and that
  nothing broke.
* Did a re-run of profiling numbers to reflect changes and updated cover
  letter and commit messages.
