Expressing intent more clearly is fine with me. I still think it's weird
for us to not have READ_ONCE() when it's a primitive operation of our
memory model, though.

And I also think we should consider using an implementation along the
lines of what I shared for our atomic_load() or READ_ONCE() or whatever
you wish to call it. The perf impact of helpers makes me sad.

Yes, I suppose that would resolve my concern about the name.

Well, I do have one partial concern there, which is that the wrong name
will show up in stack traces as long as helpers are used.

Yeah, that's right.
