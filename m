Sure, if all expiry read/update functions have their _safe_from_callback

It's not our initiative to reverse that design. That was changed long time =
ago:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/tip-5de2755c8c8b3a6b8414870e2c284914a2b42e4d@gi=
t.kernel.org/

Enforcing this would be more favourable to Rust API's design. FUJITA propos=
ed an
API which would require user to cancel the timer first before re-arming.

The issue is that for users that do want a concurrent restart, like in perf
core's use case, special care would need to be taken to avoid deadlock, as
cancellation code path must not have any lock held that is shared with the
callback.

That is indeed something we didn't consider, as Rust abstraction currently =
does
not provide a way to do it. We could change the forward return value to jus=
t be
the new expire time.

    typedef enum hrtimer_restart (*hrtimer_ext_func_t)(struct hrtimer *time=
r, ktime_t *expires);

I've kept Andreas's name to not have to bikeshed on it.

With such callbacks, users would be abel to use a helper like:

    u64 hrtimer_compute_forward(ktime_t *expires, ktime_t now, ktime_t inte=
rval)

to forward the timer.

Alternatively, instead of putting this into the callback signature, struct
hrtimer could stores an additional expires_for_callback field which gets up=
dated
from callbacks. I do think existing C callbacks can be converted to use suc=
h API
without too much churn.

It's the example that you've given. If one calls
hrtimer_forward_safe_from_callback and then immediately return RESTART, it =
would
unlock the base lock within hrtimer_forward_safe_from_callback, and upon
returning hrtimer core relocks the base lock.

Ack. FWIW we're not trying to prevent all application logic bug. It's not
possible. But what's important that we try to achieve is for a user bug to =
be
contained and not cause hrtimer core to complete breakdown.

A buggy hrtimer user that never refires? If we can somehow prevent that, gr=
eat,
but that's not required.

A buggy hrtimer user that breaks the timer wheel completely by making its d=
ata
structure internally inconsistent? That's what we're trying to prevent, at
least for Rust users. As it currently stands, an badly timed hrtimer_forwar=
d (or
hrtimer_set_expires) within callback can cause hrtimer core rbtree to viola=
te
its invariant. And that's what we want to avoid.

It's a trade-off, really. You can have simple code and complex rules, that'=
s one
way of complexity. More complex code and simpler rule is a different way of
complexity.

The way I see this is that hrtimer code will be less complex to reason abou=
t if
expires modification is not possible without the base lock held.

- "timer->expires may only be touched with base lock held" is very simple r=
ule,
  and yes the code would need some slight additional complexity.

- "timer->expires" may be touched without the base lock held, if the hrtime=
r is
  not queued, and no code can possibly queue it while it is touched." resul=
ts in
  simpler code, but the rule is more complex, and it's _non-local_ meaning =
that
  the callback code may look innocent, and all it takes is a hrtimer_start =
from
  outside the callback to mess things up.

Ack.

I shall add that this is more than a single lock/unlock. hrtimer_get_expire=
s
would need to take that lock as well.

Sure, if all expiry read/update functions have their _safe_from_callback
variant.
