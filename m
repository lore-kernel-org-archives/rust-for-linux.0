That's not the main difference, any of those primitives may be called on be=
half
of userspace with the error propagated back to userspace. Please also see m=
y
considerations in [1].

I'd rather not, let's keep it consistent with other memory allocation

I'm against this, a zero-sized dma::Coherent allocation does not make sense=
; I'd
really want to see a real use-case for this.

Agreed.
