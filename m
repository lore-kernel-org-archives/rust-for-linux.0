Yeah, this is a pain. In theory, struct kunit_case / struct kunit_suite
are internal to the executor, but we end up having to pass them around a
lot, and a way of getting the current test's attributes is, at a
minimum, something we should support.

I'd rather not expose the struct kunit_case to test authors (though
exposing it to the Rust macros is fine by me: they're sufficiently
KUnit-internal that it's fine). The ultimate best 'public' API would
probably be to have a bunch of 'kunit_get_attribute_value()' style
things, but that's definitely a more involved thing.

How about we compromise on a way to get the attributres for the current
test. The simplest implementation for that is probably just including a
pointer to struct kunit_attributes in struct kunit.

(Though the better long-term solution would be to pass a struct
kunit_case pointer in struct kunit, and generally rework things to not
pass struct kunit_case/kunit_suite around as regularly. There are a lot
of gotcha's there, though, so it's not worth holding this up on that.)

Having thought about this a bit more, I think there's a compromise:
could we make the override of assert!() and assert_eq!() only appear on
non-should_panic tests. In that case, the assert!() and assert_eq!()
will behave the same as userspace tests (indeed, they'll use the same
code), and we won't need a complicated implementation. And later if we
want the (IMO, more logical) KUnit-style assertions which aren't
negated, we could suggest people use kernel::kunit_assert!() directly
(or with a small wrapper), so it's obvious the behaviour is different
from upstream assert!().

Thoughts?
