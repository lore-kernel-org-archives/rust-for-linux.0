Sounds good, v3 will do the following, which I think aligns with the
result of the discussion:

- Anything error happening in `GspHal::boot` is the responsibility of
  the HAL to handle,
- After `GspHal::boot` has returned, `Gsp::unload` can be called safely
  so `Gsp::boot` does that using a `ScopeGuard`,
- No closures. :)

For now the error handling that HALs do is rather primitive (TU102 runs
its unload bundle, GH100 waits for the GSP lockdown release) and I am
not sure that there is room for improvement, but if there is the layout
should let us address it.

FLR can also eventually be handled at a higher layer if need be.
