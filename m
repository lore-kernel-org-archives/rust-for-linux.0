I see where you are coming from, but I see it from a different angle:

An offset given to read() can legitimately be a runtime value that happens =
to be
constrained in a way that the compiler can proof that it is within bounds (=
with
dead code elimination doing the rest). We have reasonable use-cases where t=
he
offset given to read() is not a "true" constant, and hence build_assert! is=
 the
correct tool.

subregion() is different in this regard, as we do not have reasonable use-c=
ases
where the offset is not a "true" constant. (And I would guess that this als=
o
made you choose the implementation you picked for this patch.)

It just happens that we hit a language limitation where const evaluation of=
 a
"true" constant does not work, but that does not make build time assertion =
the
correct tool, it just makes it a workaround for the existing limitation.

This is also in line with the documentation in rust/kernel/build_assert.rs.

So, you are proposing that subregion() takes an argument of type
L: impl IoLoc<_>?

Where would this argument come from?

I assume you would need to bring back

	impl RegisterBase<Foo> for Bar {
	    const BASE: usize =3D 0xff;
	}

impl blocks? Which seems like just adding boilerplate? Or do you have somet=
hing
else in mind?
