Sure, that works perfectly. Just thought, we might not want to also create a new
struct driver for each device.

Should have said in case we allow multiple devices per driver, but as long as we
already create the full "virtual_object", that's fine for sure.

Exactly that, no probe, no remove. With that we can avoid the full bus
abstraction in Rust.
