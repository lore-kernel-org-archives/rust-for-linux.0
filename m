Yeah, I don't think the problem Deborah was mentioning was about not
being able to allocate GEMs early on, or making sure those GEMs don't
outlive the bus-device. Oh, and BTW, we don't use GEMs for the page
tables themselves, those still go through regular page allocation and
are entirely handled by the io-pgtable-arm.c logic. We need early GEM
allocation to populate FW sections, and to map those to the VM attached
to the FW we need GPUVM too (because the FW also lives behind the GPU
MMU and has its own page table that's populated by the driver).

What I think Deborah was pointing out is the chicken-and-egg issue,
where the registration data is only fully populated after all
sub-components of the drivers have been initialized, and one of these
sub-components (the FW) needs to allocate GEMs and map them to its VM.
So, GEM allocation and GPUVM are required are required early on, and
both want a drm::Device of some sort (Unregistered or Registered). So
the question is, are you happy with having [1] applied before/after
your patchset to address this chicken-and-egg issue I mentioned, or are
you proposing something else (Option<Subcomponent> so that we start
with all sub-components set to None and progressively populate those,
which I remember Daniel was strongly opposed to)?
