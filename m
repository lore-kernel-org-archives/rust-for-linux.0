I hope so as the original C code for this is less than 200 lines of code :)

I wonder what it would look like to do a "real" bus in rust, maybe I'll
try that someday, but for now, I want this to be used by C code...

What artificial match?  Ah, you mean they would both be in the same
"object"?

I don't really understand the objection here.  Oooh, you want the C code
to both create/manage the driver AND the device at the same time?  Hey I
like that, it would make the interface to it even simpler!  Let me go
try that, and see if it is what you are thinking of here...

thanks!
