I re-read the docs on `TryFrom` and I have some new thoughts:
`TryFrom<device::Device> for pci::Device` is indeed similar to
`TryFrom<i64> for i32`. If the `device::Device` is embedded in a
`pci::Device`, then the `Ok` value is obvious. If not, then the error is
also clear and the user should do something in that case. So in this
regard, it's pretty natural to use `TryFrom`.

Now my initial thoughts were more on the side of if people should avoid
it, then it shouldn't be named `try_from`. But IIUC, most of the time
they won't be able to call `try_from`, since they already have the
correct type to begin with.

Ultimately this is your call to make, if you think that it's unlikely
that people will use the `try_from` in the wrong places, then go for it.

That's fair, but I think then it would lose the `Device` specific docs
about not using it if there are other options.
