Most likely. There are two known cases where interactions with this commit =
are
expected.

  (1) One of the drivers probed on your machine gets stuck within probe() (=
or
      any other place where the device lock is held, e.g. bus callbacks) fo=
r
      some reason, e.g. due to a deadlock.  In this case this commit would
      potentially cause other tasks to get stuck in driver_attach() when th=
ey
      attempt to register a driver for the same bus the bad one sits on.

      This is also the main reason why we eventually reverted this commit, =
i.e.
      despite not being the root cause of an issue, it makes an already bad
      situation worse.

  (2) If there is a driver probed on your machine that registers another dr=
iver
      from within its probe() function for the same bus it results in a
      deadlock.  Note that this is transitive -- if a driver is probed on b=
us A,
      which e.g. deploys devices on bus B that are subsequently probed, and=
 then
      in one of the probe() calls on bus B a driver is registered for bus A=
,
      that is a deadlock as well.

      For instance, this could happen when a platform driver that runs a PC=
Ie
      root complex deploys the corresponding PCI devices and one of the
      corresponding PCI drivers registers a platform driver from probe().

      Anyways, for the underlying problem this reveals, the exact constella=
tion
      doesn't matter.  The anti-pattern it reveals is that drivers shouldn'=
t be
      registered from another driver's probe() function in the first place.

      I fixed a few drivers having this anti-pattern and all of them had ot=
her
      (lifetime) issues due to this and I think there are other potential
      deadlock scenarios as well.

> Hints about how to approach the issue (if there is any) welcome.

For (1) I think it's obvious, and I think it wouldn't have gone unnoticed i=
f any
of the drivers were bad to the point that they're getting stuck in probe() =
or
any other place where the device lock is held.

As for (2) I think the best way to catch it is lockdep. Unfortunately, lock=
dep
won't be very helpful without some additional tricks, since the driver core
calls lockdep_set_novalidate_class() for the device lock to avoid false
positives.

However, we can work around this by registering a dynamic lock class key fo=
r
every struct device individually [1] and fake taking the device lock with
mutex_acquire() and mutex_release() in __driver_attach().

This way your box should still boot properly, and in case it got stuck due =
to
(2), print a proper lockdep splat.

I hope this helps!
