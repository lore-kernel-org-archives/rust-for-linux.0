The concern pointed out by Sashiko that pcim_enable_device() silently also =
sets
pdev->is_managed =3D true, which also influences the behavior of other unma=
nged
PCI paths is valid.

Of course, we could easily overcome this if we have to, but on second thoug=
ht I
think it would be nice to just not have the managed version at all.

(Note that I also have a patch in my queue to convert IrqVectorRegistration=
 to
use lifetimes instead of Devres, which will also address the topic in [1].)

The advantage of not having to store another object in the bus device priva=
te
data is minor, and a lifetime annotated guard is the more idiomatic solutio=
n
anyway.

	pub struct DeviceEnableGuard<'a> {
	    dev: &'a pci::Device<Bound>,
	}

Note that obtaining this guard would still require a &Device<Core>, but dro=
pping
it can only be ensured from a bound scope, which &'a pci::Device<Bound> ens=
ures.

This is the tricky part, as this would imply that pci_disable_device() can =
be
called concurrently with another DeviceEnableGuard being acquired and
concurrently with pci_set_master() and pci_clear_master(), etc., which give=
n the
current implementation on the C side would be UB.

It would be interesting to dig into this and see if we can find a solution =
to
this problem (which might also include improvements on the C side).

For instance, struct pci_dev has a C bitfield that also includes the
is_busmaster field, which can race with all the other bits being accessed i=
n the
same bitfield.

I think (most of) the fields should be in the same locking domain (the devi=
ce
lock, which is held in bus callbacks and in Rust represented by the Core de=
vice
context state).

But there might already be issues with this, e.g. it seems to me that
block_cfg_access is protected through a different locking domain, the same =
goes
for a few other fields I think.

Bjorn, any insights on this?

(We had a similar C bitfield in the driver core, which we recently replaced=
 by
using bitops, as there were subtle race conditions.)

If we could find a solution to the above, we could probably avoid having "r=
aw"
accessors that can potentially lead to an unbalanced enable count and inste=
ad
could consider something like a DeviceDisableGuard<'a> which could be deriv=
ed
from a DeviceEnableGuard<'a> for the duration of a suspend.

The runtime PM Rust infrastructure could provide a storage container which
lifetime wise spans suspend =3D> resume, where this guard (and other data t=
hat
must be restored on resume) could be stored.
