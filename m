JobQueue is a pure Rust component that handles job submissions for GPUs
with firmware scheduling, i.e., GPUs that support one exclusive ring per
execution context.

JobQueue's primary task is dependency handling, where the user can set
dependencies, each in the form of a `dma_buf::Fence`, on a job and then
submit it to the queue.

Jobs are being executed in order, following the FIFO principle. Only
jobs whose dependencies are all fullfilled get executed, otherwise the
JobQueue pauses.

A core design principle, just like with DmaFence, is to avoid all
allocations in job submission paths, since this runs danger of
deadlocking.

Another design principle, new when compared to the older drafts, is the
ownership relationship with fences:

  1. The JobQueue owns the FenceContext exclusively.
  2. Jobs are created on the JobQueue, ensuring correct fence sequence
     number ordering.
  3. Jobs own the respective DriverFence.
  4. Jobs are owned by the JobQueue.

Consequently, a driver can only interact with fences and FenceContext
indirectly through the JobQueue, and can also only complete jobs (and,
hence, signal fences) through the JobQueue.

Unfortunately, since jobs need a reference to the JobQueue for their
fence dependency objects (DependencyWaker), this code can currently not
be used in this form because some work on self-referential PinInit is
required. See the respective comments in the Example.

When a job shall be run, both its JobQueue::data and Job::data get
borrowed back to it, together with the sequence number of this job, so
that the driver can perform the appropriate interaction with the
hardware.

The submit_worker runs all ready jobs based on a credit count system, so
that run_job() can be infallible. The same worker drops jobs (and their
fences) that are already completed. Should this proof to be a
performance issue, a second worker could trivially be added for this.

+//! DRM's job dependency manager and load balancer for GPUs with firmware
+//! scheduling, i.e., GPUs that can spawn one ring exclusive per user context.
+//!
+//! JobQueue abstracts the entire handling of [`dma_buf::FenceContext`] and its
+//! associated [`dma_buf::DriverFence`]s for the user.
+//!
+//! In this design, a JobQueue is always the owner of a [`dma_buf::FenceContext`]
+//! which represents the timeline on the associated GPU ring. Jobs created on
+//! this JobQueue always contain a [`dma_buf::DriverFence`] from this JobQueue,
+//! where the fence sequence number corresponds with the job sequence number,
+//! and the fence's generic payload data is also the job's payload data. This
+//! allows for the dma_fence backend_ops callbacks interacting with the driver
+//! through JobQueue. The trait [`JobQueueOps`] is the interface between driver
+//! and fence backend_ops.
+//!
+//! [`Job`]s created on the [`JobQueue`] take over ownership of the user's data
+//! and prepare all memory allocations. A later job submission sets up the fence
+//! and performs no fallible operations.
+//!
+//! Before jobs are submitted to a queue, dependencies in the form of
+//! [`dma_buf::Fence`] can be set on them. Jobs are run by the JobQueue in
+//! process context through a work item in FIFO order. Only jobs whose
+//! dependency fences have all been signaled are run. If the front job's
+//! dependency is not yet fullfilled, the JobQueue pauses until that's the case.
+//!
+//! JobQueue implements a credit count system, where the queue itself gets
+//! assigned a capacity by the user, and jobs get assigned individual cost. Jobs
+//! get only pushed if there is enough capacity; if not, running stops until
+//! that is the case. These credits must accurately represent the capacity on
+//! the GPU ring the queue was created for.
+//!
+//! The driver tells the JobQueue which jobs are finished through
+//! [`JobQueue::complete_jobs_up_to_seqno()`]. This function is typically
+//! invoked through the driver's GPU interrupt handler.
+//!
+//! Since jobs might contain data that must not drop in atomic context, and
+//! since jobs' [`dma_buf::DriverFence`]s perform a call to
+//! [`rcu::synchronize_rcu()`], they are dropped through a work item if [`Drop`]
+//! is implemented for the job's payload data.
+//!
+//! From JobQueue's perspective, it is not necessary to call any of its API
+//! functions with a driver lock held; this is actually discouraged to reduce
+//! the probability of deadlocks. All JobQueue API functions are properly
+//! ordered using the internal lock.
+//!
+//! JobQueue tells drivers to run jobs through [`JobQueueOps::run_job`], which
+//! is called without the JobQueue's spinlock being held, i.e., the driver is
+//! permitted to perform sleeping operations in the callback. JobQueue handles
+//! races between `run_job` and [`JobQueueOps::complete_jobs_up_to_seqno()`].
+//!
+//! This is pure Rust code that does not directly abstract C.
