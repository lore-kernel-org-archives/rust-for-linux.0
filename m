ops->signaled() you mean.

Anyways, only one will succeed at having the fence marked as signaled
anyways, and then all other callers of dma_fence_is_signaled() will be
guarded by the fastpath bit-check (which btw is also broken; but we
want to address that in a different patch. For now my series proposes
keeping the fastpath).

Nope, I want to protect shared data, which is the signaled-state. Which
is currently a race-condition worked around with RCU (and sometimes
with manually doing the right thing (locking!)) [1], stemming from the
fact that the fence's spinlock is not used consistently.

signaled() neither needs a list lock nor any other lock.

It needs to read a sequence number from somewhere, so a u64. And then
it returns true or false to the fence_backend.

The u64 can easily be an atomic. Also ioremaped reads should work
locklessly.

No need for any lock.

I guess my question then becomes what complicated locked tasks someone
has to do within its callback that locks are required, locks that
cannot be partitioned in a smart way to avoid that.

We have 3 callbacks that are relevant and not deprecated (the name-
functions are trivially solved by copying the data):

- is_signaled() =E2=87=92 solved, see above
- enable_signaling()
- set_deadline()

The latter two might want to talk to their hardware, either enabling an
interrupt or telling it to clock the frequency up (see MSM). They might
need a driver-lock for that, fair enough.

Where does such a driver-lock need to be held while operating on a
fence, opening the deadlock-path?


Note that, as I pointed out many times, all callbacks are already
called under lock-protection. Especially enable_signaling(), and
is_signaled() must be lock-resistant, proven by
dma_fence_is_signaled_locked() existing.

Regardless, what I propose would only make a potential difference for
*new* users, with inline-lock, who can then cleanly design to avoid
locking problems.

I suspect more that drivers attempt to do unnecessarily many things in
their callbacks which are not supposed to be done there.

Our common component forces all users to take our locks manually and
plaster everything with RCU. If they forget an RCU delay, outside our
API, things explode :(
