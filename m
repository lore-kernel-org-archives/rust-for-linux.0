I understand. I'd love to help flesh out the current draft if people are
interested in seeing the result upstream. Maybe as an experimental
driver for a while.

Right. I don't think we should build a ufshci driver outside the scsi
midlayer and still provide (linux) scsi compatible interfaces for it. I
understand that userland tools need to be updated, and that carries
cost. I don't imagine enabling a standalone ufshci driver being an over
night switch. If we go down this road, I would assume the legacy driver
and a new driver would coexist for some time.

When that is said, I do think we can provide efficient user space
interfaces that would require minimal code changes for user space
tooling.

For instance, `ufs-bsg` is not really scsi related, it is just a
pass-through interface to the ufs host controller. How you find it would
be the primary change.

Best regards,
Andreas Hindborg
