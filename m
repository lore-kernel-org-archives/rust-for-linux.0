I agree, no argument from me there. The problem is, when the GPU is =
resetting,
things are far from "working". In fact, things went so bad somewhere =
that it
brought the device down for everybody, and the system is taking steps to =
(try
to) bring it up again.

As a user, I very much appreciated this when games went down, it made me =
think
that the problem was important enough to report, and also likely =
explained why,
in that particular hardware, things didn't really work 100% well =
afterwards,
which prompted me to reboot the machine.

Two outcomes could have come from that, a) filing a bug on the game =
itself, and
b) telling the kernel guys that their reset code wasn't really working =
100%
well either.

I do agree that "Starting GPU reset" is frivolous, but at least a =
message
saying that a reset took place, either sucessfully or not, is better =
than
silence. In fact, isn't this exactly what AMDGPU does? [2].

I guess that also works, so long as it says that the GPU is resetting? =
i.e.:
it=E2=80=99s not only a fault or something, but also a message saying =
=E2=80=9Cthis fault=E2=80=9D (or
whatever it was) is causing a reset.
