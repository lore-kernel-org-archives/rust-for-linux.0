Since we're into complaining about social media posts on the list now,
I'm going to link one of yours:

https://chaos.social/@sima/113961496955043901

An R4L maintainer quit after multiple rounds of hostility, including
some completely unacceptable public comments bordering on downright
harassment from tytso, a situation which was widely publicized.

If, according to you, that's "shockingly smooth" with "no outsized
drama" other than "what I stirred up" (I guess you also missed the whole
LWN post about this thread before I posted anything on Fedi? That's how
I even found out about this), then I'm glad I'm disengaging with this
community. The Stockholm syndrome and utter denial is palpable.

I thought I could work with you on these issues; I don't know what
happened over the past year since we last had a private conversation
about this, but clearly you've changed your mind.

Thus, as you kindly requested of me in social media,

https://chaos.social/@sima/113961283260455876

I will now proceed to fuck off. Good luck.

- Hector
