Owing to the ongoing discussion in v8, I still think we could propose =
some
refinements in the future, like most source code out there :) But =
overall this
is a solid base to build upon and it doesn=E2=80=99t make sense to delay =
seeking
the =E2=80=9Cperfect=E2=80=9D solution, if such a thing even exists..


Thanks for your hard work here!
