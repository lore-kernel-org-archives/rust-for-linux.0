You are comparing the C vs. Rust data structures here, which is not what
I am proposing.

Also, is this code being used on a "hot path" like the binder stuff is?

Again, I'm not talking about Rust API vs. imported C bitmaps, I'm asking
to use the C structures like maple-tree and idr instead of open-coding
logic around the bitmap code.

Allocating IDs is a probe() thing, which can be as slow as it wants,
right?  Or is this some other hot-path where performance matters?  The
patch was not very specific as to the tradeoffs needed.
