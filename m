Please note that I did not ask to change any of that in the context of
chipset/architecture enums.

What I said is that I don't want to incentivise userspace to derive the
architecture of a chip on its own, given that the kernel already does this.=
 (If
it is never needed, that's fine too, then we don't need to export it. :)

Of course, architecture and engine class id can't be used interchangeably. =
The
engine class id is more fine grained. For instance, the engine class id is
different for GA100 compared to all other Ampere chips.

At a quick glance the code above looked to me as if it doesn't care about t=
he
engine class id, because the granularity is architecture granularity and no=
t
engine class id granularity. But at a second glance, I think you are actual=
ly
deriving the engine class id and it just happens that the code does not nee=
d to
consider e.g. AMPERE_A vs. AMPERE_B, which is why you don't have an
is_ampere_{a,b}() accessor I suppose.

That said, nova can easily export the engine class id information instead o=
f the
architecture; the kernel will likely need the engine class id anyway. (Alth=
ough
it depends a bit on the GSP-RM API, I think technically it could get away
without the driver passing it in.)

Yes, Alistair confirmed this too:

	Yes, I did look into this. Unfortunately the SM version GSP currently
	reports is different from the SM userspace code generation tools need (I
	have no idea why, there appear to be way too many SM versions).

However, I don't think we have to just give up on all this. We have NVIDIA
people working on the project and firmware changes are made specifically fo=
r the
project already. So, ultimately I think it would be great to understand why=
 that
is and possibly provide the correct information.
