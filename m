Adding Linus

My 2c: If Linus doesn't pipe up with an authoritative answer to this
thread, Miguel and the other Rust folks should just merge this series
once it is reviewed and ready, ignoring Christoph's overt attempt at
sabotaging the project. If Linus pulls it, what Christoph says doesn't
matter. If Linus doesn't pull it, the R4L project is essentially dead
until either Linus or Christoph make a move. Everything else is beating
around the bush.

Rust folks: Please don't waste your time and mental cycles on drama like
this. It's not worth your time. Either Linus likes it, or he doesn't.
Everything else is distractions orchestrated by a subset of saboteur
maintainers who are trying to demoralize you until you give up, because
they know they're going to be on the losing side of history sooner or
later. No amount of sabotage from old entrenched maintainers is going to
stop the world from moving forward towards memory-safe languages.

FWIW, in my opinion, the "cancer" comment from Christoph would be enough
to qualify for Code-of-Conduct action, but I doubt anything of the sort
will happen.
