No, but I wonder if it's really worth going all the way. And I did ask the LLM
about this too (of course :)

The way it works now there's still a bunch of .long offset entries in the
assembly which can actually be put into the binary file (the series generates a
binary file for the byte tables and includes using .incbin).

So mostly it's binary already.

If we tried to generate an ELF file directly there'd be complications (LLM says
e_flags and fun with arch-specific ABIs, plus arch's relocation type for
_text-relative base).

I don't think there'd be much of a win for the added complexity (and I am
nervous of fiddling with arch-specific stuff), BUT, can definitely put
those remaining .long entries in the binary too so the assembly is
absolutely minimal.

LLM says there's 200k of those, so does seem worthwhile, I'll do that for
v2!
