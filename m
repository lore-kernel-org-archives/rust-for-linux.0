	More to the point, papering over that at runtime is wrong, and not
just for modifying descriptor tables - fdget() is just as wrong in anything
that can be called from tail of do_exit().

	It's exactly the same as with "what if it gets called from an
rcu callback?" - it's a bug, that's what.  Don't use these primitives
in such context.

	In particular, ->release() mentioned upthread should not be allowed
to access _anything_ hanging off current, not just descriptor table.  Note
that the last reference to an opened file might be sitting in an SCM_RIGHTS
datagram pruned by AF_UNIX garbage collector; as far as the method is concerned,
it might be called from random thread.

	If it tries to access (let alone modify) the current descriptor table,
you have no memory safety whatsoever and checking if current->files happens
to be NULL is nowhere near enough to resolve that.

	I don't know how to express that gracefully in terms of typechecking -
sure, we could pass an empty token to each syscall, have fdget() et.al.
require that as an argument and propagate the damn thing to all such callsites,
but that would cause an insane amount of churn - if nothing else, ->ioctl()
signature would have to be changed and there's a _lot_ of instances out there.
And then there's the joy of dealing with ->sendmsg() and ->recvmsg(),
thanks to SCM_RIGHTS datagrams, again (reading descriptor table on sendmsg()
side, inserting into it on recvmsg()), especially when you consider the
fact that ->sendmsg() and ->recvmsg() *are* callable from contexts where
one shouldn't be allowed to access descriptor tables.  None of such
call chains is going to trigger descriptor table access (e.g. knbd is
not going to try and send SCM_RIGHTS datagrams, etc.), so it should be
safe, but having compiler prove that without inflicting overhead on
the code paths where it really wouldn't be welcome is not going to be trivial.


Al, finally back to the state when reading from screen is tolerable for
reasonably long time - dry eyes were _really_ not fun to deal with...
