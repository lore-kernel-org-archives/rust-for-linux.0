yes, compiler barrier is the wrong language here

So if the compiler does obey the store_release barrier, then we're ok.

IOW, that has to override the "compiler sees the non-atomic store as a
hint..." - but the thing is, since we're moving more to type system
described concurrency than helpers, I wonder if that will actually be
the case.

Also, what's the situation with reads? Can we end up in a situation
where a non-atomic read causes the compiler do erronious things with an
atomic_load(..., relaxed)?
