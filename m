=46rom a simple case of 'what is here' in this set, the only bit I'm seeing
change in order to implement what I think you and Jason are describing is we
don't bother checking the cert chain in kernel for the first time: We
provide that to userspace to decide if it's good. If I understand
correctly, this will be at the end of the full sequence once we've pushed
through a nonce and gotten signatures + measurements.  Same as checking a
TSM provided transcript. That was sort of happening anyway if we consider
the .cma keyring as just providing a short cut filter if we didn't trust
the device provided root cert.
User space got the transcripts before it had to make any decision on
binding and could do anything it liked with them.

For that caching the public key bit, I'm not clear on whether you intend
to do that from kernel side (which I think I'd prefer) or have user space
squirt that key back in again?  If we are doing it in kernel we can
at least always verify the transcript is self consistent and refuse to
give anything to user space if it's not consistent (other than debug materi=
al).
By self consistent I mean we verify the signature against the device provid=
ed
cert (might as well verify whole chain as that's trivial given we have to p=
artly
parse them anyway to find the cert).  I don't think it maters hugely if
we do this in kernel beyond advantage of removing a few foot guns and
simplifying the userpace interface to "I'm fine with the provided transcript
for use when I'm not here next time" write. Disadvantage is we use the
cert parsing code (which is there anyway) and parse it all twice - once
in kernel and probably again in userspace or at some remote verifier.

Measurement verification (in kernel) is potentially a trickier bit of ABI
design as the space of what might be in there and what matters for a given
device is complex to say the least.  Only a small part of that is spec
defined.

I can see there may be some use cases where we relax things beyond this
(potentially including .cma keyring and root cert only)
