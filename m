This is a bit concerning. You can white out Rust in that and plonk in
some corporate backed project people tried to cram into the kernel
without understanding the community aspects. I'm not saying it's 
the same but the tone reads the same.

"The `net` subsystem" have given "the RustForLinux community" clear
guidance on what a good integration starting point is. And now someone
else from Rust comes in and talk about supporting OOT modules.

I thought the Rust was just shaking up the languages we use, not the
fundamentals on how this project operates :|
