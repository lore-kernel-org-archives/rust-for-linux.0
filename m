Of course, I am on the receiving end of a flood of LLM patches in mm, so it's
important to me to be transparent and consistent.

I repeatedly tell people - audit what it makes with a human pass, fix up
awful code/comments/commit msgs, make sure you understand it + on you to
make upstreamable + obviously ack that you used it.

So what's good for the goose is good for the gander :)

Ack thanks. I will continue to include them in respins just to enforce the
ordering in the meantime, but it should all come out in the wash I think?

I can add something in the cover letter too about these.

Thanks so much for taking a look! I'll be at plumbers so feel free to come
say hi + discuss any of this in person.

And thanks to everybody else reviewing also!

I've replied to the more straightforward stuff, will take a deeper look at
Linus's comments + anything else that needs a deeper think + sashiko
reports a little later before sending a v2.
