I don't believe it does. Remember that we have full control of the abstractions,
so we can (and will when the need arises) build an abstraction that provides the
functionality you describe. For the read path, we can have functions that return
a read-only guard (which is the gateway to the data in Rust) when locking either
of the locks, or when showing evidence that either lock is already locked (i.e.,
by temporarily transferring ownership of another guard). Note that this is
another area where Rust offers advantages: read-only guards (in C, if you take a
read lock, nothing prevents you from making changes to fields you should only be
allowed to read); and the ability to take temporary ownership, giving it back
even within the same function.

Similarly, to access a mutable guard, you'd have to show evidence that both
locks are held.

Why not? RCU is a lock -- it may have zero cost in most (all?) architectures on
the read path, but it is a lock. We can model access to variables/fields
protected by it just like any other lock, with the implementation of lock/unlock
optimizing to no-ops on the read path where possible.

In fact, this is also an advantage of Rust. It would *force* developers to
lock/unlock the RCU lock before they can access the protected data.

These would be great, but would still fall short of the compile-time guaranteed
safety that Rust offers in these cases.

I encourage you to pursue this. We'd all benefit from better C. I'd be happy to
review and provide feedback on proposed extensions that are deemed
equivalent/better than what Rust offers.

My background is also in C. I'm no Rust fanboy, I'm just taking what I think is
a pragmatic view of the available options.
