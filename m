Of course we could encode this implementation detail, but I think there's n=
o
reason to do so.

For instance currently we refer to GA100 as

	Chipset::GA100

but with the above we'd refer to GA100 as

	Arch::Ampere(AmpereImpl::GA100)

which is not buying us anything, is it?

It also would be confusing because both the architecture and the specific c=
hip
would now be both represented by a type called Arch.

This I agree with, which is also why I mentioned we should export SM if GSP
already provides it to us.

No, the only thing userspace ever uses to distinguish between things is eit=
her
by architecture or by chip. If we instead provide architecture and some ID
userspace will just go

	if (arch =3D=3D Ampere && id =3D=3D 0)
		chip =3D GA100;
	else if (arch =3D=3D Ampere && id =3D=3D 2)
		chip =3D GA102;
	[...]

and after that never care about the ID again. Whereas with giving userspace=
 the
chip and architecture as separate fields userspace is done.
