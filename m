I confess some bemusement on the allergy to READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE().
However, we have a similar thing within the Linux kernel.  READ_ONCE()
is the same as atomic_read() from am memory-ordering perspective,
and WRITE_ONCE() is the same as atomic_set() from a memory-ordering
perspective.  The difference is typing.  READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE()
will eat anything, but atomic_read() and atomic_set() insist on pointers
to atomic_t.  There is also atomic_long_t and atomic64_t, just in case
you want more API members.  ;-)
