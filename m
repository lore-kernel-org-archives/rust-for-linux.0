I thought about this too, and I agree we should support this.

The advantage is that the userspace side can remain much simpler (especiall=
y in
memory safe languages), since it can just use the size of its struct versio=
n.

IOW, the "buffer is smaller than struct" case goes into the kernel, where w=
e
could leverage a UserSliceWriter::write_truncated() helper [1].

When userspace passes a bigger buffer than needed by the kernel we should n=
ot
return an error code; a newer userspace can work perfectly fine with an old=
er
kernel.

We could still keep the probe semantics for size =3D=3D 0 though. It should=
n't cost
us anything, as it should be trivial. And it could be useful for diagnostic
purposes / tooling to dump the full kernel struct regardless of version (e.=
g.
for bug reports).
