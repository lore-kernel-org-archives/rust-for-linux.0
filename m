It has nothing to do with Rust, those driver lifecycle rules exist regardle=
ss
and they are present universally, including in C.

The only difference is that in C all the responsibility to enforce them is
usually on the driver -- e.g. by creating, destroying and calling things in=
 the
correct order in probe() and remove() -- and a lot of drivers have bugs in =
this
regard as a consequence.

With Rust we can enforce those rules with the help of the type system at co=
mpile
time; device context states are a part of that.

This is a huge understatement.

The state of a device being bound to a driver defines which entity (i.e. wh=
ich
driver) is in charge of operating the underlying device, and thus defines w=
ho
owns the device (associated) resources.

Many APIs rely on this, as in they only guarantee valid behavior when calle=
d
from a scope where the device is guaranteed to be bound to a driver, or IOW
where a driver can prove that it actually operates the device.

Drivers must only acquire device resources when they are actually bound to =
the
corresponding device, and must hand them back before the device is unbound.=
 The
devres API, for instance, exists for this fundamental reason.

For instance, we can't have drivers manage IRQs, mess with I/O memory, prog=
ram
IOMMU page tables (e.g. through DMA APIs), etc. for devices they are not bo=
und
to and hence are not allowed to operate (anymore).

Those device resources all have a lifetime that is tied to the lifetime of =
the
device being bound to a driver.

Consequently, any asynchronous scopes such as IOCTLs from class device
registrations, IRQs, work queued on workqueues, etc. must all be synchroniz=
ed in
some way such that those asynchronous scopes do not access device resources=
 that
have already been destroyed on driver unbind.

Or in other words, they must be synchronized against the "bound" scope, whi=
ch is
exactly what the Device<Bound> type state in Rust represents.

So, again, all those lifetime rules around the driver lifecycle exist
universally, it's just that in Rust we enforce them through the type system=
.

For instance, tying it back to USB, we don't want that a usb_driver still m=
esses
with a usb_interface, e.g. initiating transfers after it has been unbound f=
rom
the interface and hence must not operate it anymore. This can easily happen=
 if
e.g. a class device registration is not properly synchronized and the drive=
r
still receives IOCTLs after driver unbind. In Rust we know through the "Bou=
nd"
type state which scope provides the guarantee that the device is still boun=
d,
such that mistakes like this become impossible.
