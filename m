I appreciate all of the testing that you have done! I will test this
side by side on a couple of my own machines to see what results I get
but I do like those results.

Thank you for calling all of this out as well.

As I note in other threads of this review, I think we should take these
to Linus now, they seem Obviously CorrectTM and it helps chunk out the
series.

I have just reviewed a few of the low hanging fruit patches. I will try
to take a look at the rest over the next couple of weeks but I might not
get to them until after Plumbers. I would greatly appreciate if there
are others who are more knowledgeable in these areas who could review
these changes, as I don't know too much about some of the corners of
Kbuild yet.
