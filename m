Class can be stored in global map, but DEPT needs to keep a timestamp
in each page to track when a potential-wait e.g. folio_lock() has been
started and to refer to the information on its event e.g. folio_unlock().

Exactly.  Only considering classes, you are right.

Right, lockdep works that way.

It's certainly useful to track who owns the lock, but the essence, when
it comes to deadlock detection, lies elsewhere.  DEPT is based on the
essence, that is, a deadlock comes from waits that are never awakened.

It's an interesting approach if your goal is to track the owenership,
but if the goal is for tracking dependencies.. well.. I'm not sure.
