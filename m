I agree; this is a strange discussion.

What is it that people want to protect against?  If the issue is 
undefined behavior caused by a second party modifying the source of a 
memcpy() while the copy is in progress -- well, there's no way to 
protect against that.  You just have to make sure either that it cannot 
happen or else that you can cope with potentially torn values in the 
copy's destination.

Is the issue a matter of informing verifiers or sanitizers that a data 
race during a memcpy() shouldn't count as undefined behavior?  Surely 
the way to do this depends on the verifier/sanitizer in question.  As 
far as I know, there is no version of memcpy() whose arguments are 
declared to be pointers to atomics.  (And if such a thing did exist, it 
would be part of C++, not of C.)
