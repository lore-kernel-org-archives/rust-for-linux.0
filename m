Tracking the number was agreed on as a compromise to move the
abstraction forward. It only exists for a warning-print.

The signaled status is absolutely decisive for preventing that both the
DriverFence::data and FenceContext cannot be reached anymore by both C
*and* Rust code consuming a Fence.

The reason is that the fence backend ops can reach the DriverFence and
the FenceContext. Only signalling the fence decouples them, and then
you still have to wait for an RCU grace period to be sure that all
accessors are gone. This is what the C backend forces on us, but it
also applies for someone doing (future implementations of)
Fence::get_driver_name() or Fence::is_signaled().

Refcounting does not solve the fundamental issue. A dma_fence must
always correctly represent the state of the associated job on the GPU.
If you forget a fence, you might deadlock. If you signal a fence for a
job that is still running on the GPU, you might get unnoticed memory
corruptions.

Refcounting the fctx was also my solution, but was objected to by
various parties (IIRC at least Boris and Danilo) who argue that the
life time is the proper solution. If I understood correctly the major
objection is that the refcount enables the device resources in
FenceContext::data to arbitrarily outlive its device, which is
something Danilo is very concerned about.


Anyways, as we discussed in the call, and as also my code comment in
FenceContext::drop() highlights, this atomic is only there for printing
a warning, because the proper solution we actually want is to have the
FenceContext signal all forgotten fences when it drops. *Then* you are
really completely safe, because then the forgotten fences get decoupled
from the fence context. So no UAF, although a driver that forgets
fences would still be broken.

The reason why (IIRC) Alice proposed doing the counter + warning and a
TODO entry is to move forward faster with the fence implementation,
which I understood is also in Tyr's interest (regarding this unlikely
bug).

The reason why it is not solved right now is that you need a data
structure in FenceContext that keeps track of unsignaled fences.
Entries in that data structure then have to be pre-allocated. And you
have to remove entries from the data structure *whenever a fence
signals*.

The only good data structure we have in Rust currently is XArray, which
we cannot use because:
 * it uses `usize` as an index, but dma_fence seqno is u64, so this
   could become a problem for Tyr, supporting 32-bit architectures.
 * We'd need to wait for Andreas' reservation mechanism for XArray.
 * XArray is not a good data structure for ever-increasing seqnos like
   the u64 of dma_fence. It quickly performance-degrades because it
   preserves index order, resulting in like a dozen pointer
   indirections for large indices.


So I had investigated using a List, but the list would force you then
to shove another refcounting mechanism (ListArc) on top of the stored
fences, and Rust's list implementation is really not trivial to be
used. At least not for me. Getting this right would take time.

Note that with the JobQueue design we're aiming at right now,
DriverFence and FenceContext would all be owned by JobQueue, so the
driver couldn't ever forget a DriverFence whithout also forgetting the
FenceContext. Hence, for the forseeable future, no one will encounter
that bug.

So, long story short, this is a solvable TODO, but we need a good data
structure for it. Preferably a hash table? Or the list implementation
needs to be improved so that it can take an ARef<Fence> instead of a
ListArc<Fence>. But someone needs to do that work.


Please tell me whether you agree with proceeding like this and make
FenceContext::drop() completely waterproof later, or whether you want
to suggest to do that now =E2=80=93 but then I'd need help with the data
structures.

Well, the name IMO needs to reflect that this method creates some fency
object. So just "new_allocation" is not good I think because you want
to see *what* is being allocated.

new_fence_allocation() maybe?

This little helper is only used internally, and where it is used other
code bits have to operate on the rawpointer with other unsafe blocks.
At other places we use the fence rawpointer without taking the lock. So
I'm not sure whether this will ever be clean.


The only reason I added it was that I by now had 3 places where I do
unsafe { } lock and unlock.

Lyude's code is not yet merged.

I do run rustfmt. It doesn't do anything about this line.
