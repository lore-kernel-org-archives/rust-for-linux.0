Maybe we have a different understanding of what "next cycle" means. As of t=
oday
we are in the v7.4 cycle, so I call this the current cycle.

In the next cycle, as discussed in [1], rust-next will drop casts::*_into_*=
(),
and so would drm-rust-next, if we start using casts::*_into_*() in nova-cor=
e
this cycle.

I don't want this situation, so we can either keep casts::*_into_*() around=
 for
even longer, or just never start using it.

It would come at the price of adding cross tree dependencies and converting=
 the
cv! parts twice, which is much worse than one clean and independent convers=
ion.
