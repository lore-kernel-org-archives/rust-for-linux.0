The find_insn() in next_insn_same_sec() is a bit odd, that was itself
part of a performance optimization, but yes, a 'next' pointer could be
used instead.  Though, IIRC, that instruction struct is the biggest
overall user of memory, and it just barely fits inside a cache line
boundary, which we do take advantage of by putting them in adjacent
blocks.

But as you alluded to, find_insn() has a lot more users beyond just
next_insn_same_sec(), like finding jump targets, alternatives, annotated
instructions, and quite a bit more.  Determining in advance which subset
of instructions need to be hashed is likely somewhere between "too
painful to change" and "not feasible" IMO.

There might be more efficient ways to structure the considerable amount
of data, like replacing "struct instruction" with "struct basic_block"
or so, but it's hard to know whether that would be a net positive.

At least the current design is a somewhat tolerable balance of
CPU/memory usage and maintainability.  Peter and I already fixed most of
the major performance issues, so I'm not overly motivated to squeeze the
last remaining juice of performance, especially if it's going to hurt
maintainability (maintainer bandwidth is also a precious resource).
