Technically, this would be an additional driver match criteria, i.e. the na=
me
string in struct auxiliary_device_id *and* the asserted type of the parent'=
s
registration data must match.

Given that drivers can match against multiple entries in the auxiliary_devi=
ce_id
table, we must consider that they can have different registration data type=
s
(depending on the specific parent driver that exposed the auxiliary device)=
.

Thus, I don't think we can solve this without a runtime dispatch (over all =
types
that would need to be listed in the ID table) anyway; and having this dispa=
tch
in the child driver - essentially leaking an implementation detail of each =
of
the parents into the child - does not seem to add any value; quite the oppo=
site
unfortunately.

(OOC, I hacked up the statically typed version -- I think it turns out OK,
despite the fact that it still leaks the parent's registration private data=
 type
to the child, which I dislike, plus a few hiccups with the generic device
context infrastructure. But as mentioned, I don't think that's an option in=
 the
first place.)
