Subject: [PATCH v3 0/23] rust: drm: KMS abstractions for a Rust display driver
Date: Wed, 26 Aug 2026 17:31:31 +0100

KMS abstractions for a Rust display driver, continuing Lyude Paul's KMS series
rather than replacing it. The first patch adapts that work to the DRM APIs as
they stand today, and the rest add what a real driver turned out to need

Broadly they fall into four groups:

  Lifetime and ownership: mode-object references tied to their owners, owned
    CRTC and vblank references, a safe constructor for owned registration data,
    pinning the owner while DRM files remain open, and rejecting cross-device
    GEM handle creation
  Properties a driver must read or publish: typed colour and rotation, plane
    blend mode, FB_DAMAGE_CLIPS, connector colorimetry and HDR metadata, and a
    connector's requested link depth
  Callbacks and state: connector detect() and mode_valid(), common state and
    connector helpers, checked plane geometry, walking the CRTCs an atomic
    commit carries, and CRTC mode changes
  Modes and framebuffers: an owned display mode constructor, mode flags and CTA
    VIC matching, synthesized CVT connector modes, and validated shmem scanout
    views

Also here are the HDCP 2.2 message identifiers, which are DRM UAPI rather than
driver constants

Changes since v2:

  Lyude's 43 commits are carried in order and patch-identical to the imported
    source, with her messages and tags untouched and no trailer of mine on any
    of them. v2 mixed her work with adaptations of mine and obscured the
    attribution, which was the fair complaint
  Everything of mine on top is a separate commit, and it is either an
    adaptation to a DRM API that has moved or a safety extension a driver
    needed
  The i2c adapter-provider patch is dropped. Igor Korotin's work is active and
    its provider-lifetime question is not one to answer privately in a driver,
    so the kernel driver registers no downstream I2C adapter this round
  The typed event channels and the private ioctl compat translations are
    dropped. Both existed for a second consumer that is not part of this
    posting, so neither has a user in what is sent
  The hardware-cursor support that was a separate v2 patch is folded into the
    plane work it belongs to

Two overlaps worth naming. Alvin Sun's
"Fix missing fops.owner in Rust DRM/misc abstractions" fixes the same bug as
"rust: drm: pin the owner while DRM files remain open", from the other end,
through ModuleMetadata rather than by threading an owning module through
UnregisteredDevice::new(). Theirs is the better shape and mine should be dropped
the moment it lands; it is still load-bearing today because upstream
UnregisteredDevice::new() takes no module. And where an early patch here fixes a
commit of Lyude's that is itself unmerged, that fix would be better folded into
her next revision than carried separately, and I am happy to do it that way

v2: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260703030123.2814-1-mike@fireburn.co.uk

The rest of the posting, which is one series per subsystem:

  rust-core, 9 patches, rust-for-linux and linux-kernel
  https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260826162851.2497-1-mike@fireburn.co.uk
  rust-crypto, 2 patches, linux-crypto and rust-for-linux
  https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260826163004.3365-1-mike@fireburn.co.uk
  rust-usb, 5 patches, linux-usb and rust-for-linux
  https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260826163101.4168-1-mike@fireburn.co.uk
  rust-drm, 23 patches, this one
  rust-firmware, 1 patch, to linux-kernel and rust-for-linux, not sent yet
  drm-vino, 13 patches, to dri-devel, not sent yet

Vino is the user for all of them. The abstractions themselves are generic and
carry no knowledge of DisplayLink

The whole thing is one branch, base and prerequisites included, which is the
quickest way to read it:

  git clone -b vino-v3 https://github.com/FireBurn/linux
  cd linux
  make LLVM=1 rustavailable
  make LLVM=1 -j$(nproc)
  make LLVM=1 -j$(nproc) modules

CONFIG_RUST=y and CONFIG_DRM_VINO=m are the two to set; DRM_VINO selects the
rest of what it needs

It is the exact tree these patches were generated from, at 4c9ba407018e, the
drm-rust-next tip of 2026-08-06. drm-next has moved on since, and this follows
drm-rust-next deliberately: the KMS layer underneath this work lives only there,
and that tree picks up drm-next on its own schedule

Two commits on the branch are not in any of the series above, because they
enable no part of Vino: a scheduler call site that stops compiling under the
locking-guard series, and the Kms associated type Tyr needs once the KMS
registration trait requires one

It applies to the base above plus this, and nothing else:

  Lyude Paul, Rust bindings for KMS + RVKMS
  https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250305230406.567126-1-lyude@redhat.com

The reference branch also carries Boqun Feng's counted interrupt disabling
series, which SpinLockIrq needs. One patch of it is already in tip locking/core
as e901c1510e24

These patches were written with the assistance of Claude (Anthropic), used
through Claude Code as an interactive coding assistant, across the design, the
implementation and the tests. Every patch it contributed to carries an
Assisted-by trailer. The Signed-off-by is mine: I have reviewed and tested what
is here and I stand behind it
