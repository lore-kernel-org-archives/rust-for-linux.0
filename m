Right, as far as this abstraction is concerned, all that needs to hold
is that:

- alloc_pages() and __free_pages() work as intended, however that may
be, to reserve and return one page (for now, though I think extending
the Rust abstraction to handle higher-order folios is pretty easy, but
that can happen later).
- Whatever borrows pages knows what it's doing. In this case there's
only support for borrowing pages by physaddr, and it's only going to be
used in a driver for a platform without memory hot remove (so far) and
only for pages which have known usage (in principle) and are either
explicitly allocated or known pinned or reserved, so it's not a problem
right now. Future abstractions that return borrowed pages can do their
own locking/bookkeeping/whatever is necessary to keep it safe.

I would like to hear how memory hot-remove is supposed to work though,
to see if we should be doing something to make the abstraction safer
(though it's still unsafe and always will be). Is there a chance a
`struct page` could vanish out from under us under some conditions?

For dev_pagemap memory I imagine we'd have an entirely different
abstraction wrapping that, that can just return a borrowed &Page to give
the user access to page operations without going through Owned<Page>.

Yeah, I don't know how that stuff works...
