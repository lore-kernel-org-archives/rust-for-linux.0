The statement "Nothing that works with =y stops working" appears to have
exceptions. The patch itself adds this to kernel/bpf/preload/Kconfig:

>     depends on DEBUG_INFO_BTF!=m

This makes BPF_PRELOAD no longer selectable with =m, and a later paragraph
acknowledges this ("CONFIG_BPF_PRELOAD is not selectable with =m").

Additionally, BPF programs that need kernel types before the root file
system is mounted work with =y but fail with =m unless btf_vmlinux.ko is
in the initramfs, which the changelog mentions later.

Could the opening sentence be reworded to acknowledge these exceptions,
for example: "Apart from BPF_PRELOAD and early-boot users without
btf_vmlinux.ko in the initramfs, nothing that works with =y stops
working"?

The new section lists when the btf_vmlinux module is loaded, and mentions
that bpf_snprintf_btf() and bpf_seq_printf_btf() handle the missing-BTF
case because they run in program context. The ftrace argument printer is
another caller that can reach the loader, and it can run with interrupts
disabled.

With CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=m, CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACE_ARGS is still enabled
because it depends on PROBE_EVENTS_BTF_ARGS, which is a bool that treats
the m dependency as y. The func-args and funcgraph-args trace options
print arguments through this call chain:

kernel/trace/trace_output.c:print_function_args():
  t = btf_find_func_proto(name, &btf);
kernel/trace/trace_btf.c:btf_find_func_proto():
  id = bpf_find_btf_id(func_name, BTF_KIND_FUNC, btf_p);
kernel/bpf/btf.c:bpf_find_btf_id():
  btf = bpf_get_btf_vmlinux();
kernel/bpf/verifier.c:bpf_get_btf_vmlinux():
  if (!btf_vmlinux_data(&size, true))
kernel/bpf/btf.c:btf_vmlinux_data():
  request_module("btf_vmlinux");

This is also reached from ftrace_dump() in the oops/panic notifier and
from sysrq-z:

kernel/trace/trace.c:ftrace_dump_one():
  local_irq_save(flags);
  ...
  ret = print_trace_line(&iter);  -> ... -> print_function_args()

request_module() sleeps: it calls down_timeout() and
call_modprobe(..., UMH_WAIT_PROC), which waits for a usermode helper.
If the BTF has not been parsed yet, bpf_get_btf_vmlinux() takes
mutex_lock(&btf_vmlinux_lock) with GFP_KERNEL allocations. Either way,
this path sleeps with interrupts disabled. In panic, the other CPUs have
been stopped, so the modprobe wait may hang and block the dump or any
reboot after it.

With =y, late_initcall kfunc registrations parse the vmlinux BTF during
boot, so this path only does the lockless acquire load. With =m,
btf_defer_reg() queues those registrations and does not load the BTF,
so it can stay NULL until the trace printer runs.

Can this be triggered with CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=m, func-args or
funcgraph-args set, ftrace_dump_on_oops (or sysrq-z), and no BPF user
of the vmlinux BTF since boot?

One option is to make print_function_args() use bpf_peek_btf_vmlinux(),
as bpf_btf_printf_prepare() already does. The doc trigger list also
leaves out other non-program loaders: reading the trace file with
func-args, kprobe/fprobe events with BTF arguments, struct_ops map
creation, bpffs delegate_* options and netfilter ctx access.

Does making DEBUG_INFO_BTF selectable as =m keep PROBE_EVENTS_BTF_ARGS
and FUNCTION_TRACE_ARGS enabled? Since bool dependents treat m as y, the
tracing output path would call the vmlinux BTF lookup, and under =m that
lookup can sleep.

The chain from the function_graph printers goes:
print_fn_trace() -> print_function_args() -> btf_find_func_proto() ->
bpf_find_btf_id() -> bpf_get_btf_vmlinux() ->
btf_vmlinux_data(&size, true) -> request_module("btf_vmlinux").

request_module() calls down_timeout(), kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL) in
call_modprobe(), and waits for modprobe with UMH_WAIT_PROC. These
printers run from ftrace_dump_one(), which does local_irq_save(flags)
before looping on print_trace_line(). ftrace_dump_one() is reached from
ftrace_dump_on_oops/panic, sysrq-z, <func>:dump function probes, kdb
ftdump and RCU stall dumps.

If the func-args or funcgraph-args option is on and nothing has loaded
the BTF yet, the dump hits 'sleeping function called from invalid
context' and schedules with IRQs disabled. In the panic/oops path the
other CPUs are stopped and usermode helpers cannot run, so the dump can
hang.

With =y the BTF is parsed at boot and bpf_get_btf_vmlinux() returns from
its fast path, so this path could not sleep before this change. Earlier
in the series, a commit added bpf_peek_btf_vmlinux() for
bpf_snprintf_btf()/bpf_seq_printf_btf() because they 'cannot afford a
fetch that may sleep', but the tracing output path was not converted.

Should btf_find_func_proto() use a non-loading lookup
(bpf_peek_btf_vmlinux()) or skip the lookup when !preemptible(), or
should PROBE_EVENTS_BTF_ARGS/FUNCTION_TRACE_ARGS depend on
DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y?

The help text says the btf_vmlinux module is loaded when
/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux is opened. Does opening the file actually load
the module?

Looking at kernel/bpf/sysfs_btf.c, the file is a bin_attribute, and
struct bin_attribute has no open callback. The BTF is loaded only from
btf_sysfs_vmlinux_read() and btf_sysfs_vmlinux_mmap(), and the comment
there says 'the first read() or mmap() loads the BTF'. stat() and open()
without a read leave the module unloaded, which the commit message's
btf_sysfs selftest note about stat() relies on.

Should this say 'first read or mapped' instead of 'opened'? The commit
message has the same wording ('opening /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux ... each
load it').

Once DEBUG_INFO_BTF can be =m, does 'make localmodconfig' silently turn
it off?

scripts/kconfig/streamline_config.pl maps loaded modules to configs only
through obj-$(CONFIG_X) lines. Any =m config it cannot tie to a loaded
module is written out as '# CONFIG_X is not set'. The only rule for the
carrier module is kernel/bpf/Makefile 'ifeq ($(CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF),m)'
/ 'obj-m += btf_vmlinux.o', which the script cannot map, and btf_vmlinux
is usually not loaded when lsmod is captured anyway.

So a distribution config with CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=m loses
DEBUG_INFO_BTF under localmodconfig. olddefconfig then also drops
DEBUG_INFO_BTF_MODULES, SCHED_CLASS_EXT, NET_SCH_BPF, IO_URING_BPF_OPS,
BINFMT_MISC_BPF and PROBE_EVENTS_BTF_ARGS. With =y these options were
kept, because the script leaves built-in options alone. The only
workaround is LMC_KEEP.

Could the Makefile use an obj-$(CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF)-style rule that
streamline_config can map, or could streamline_config preserve this
symbol?

With CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=m, external modules (M=) now only get BTF if
vmlinux.unstripped exists. The in-tree packaging still ships only vmlinux
for this purpose.

scripts/package/PKGBUILD's _package-debug does 'install -Dt
"${debugdir}" -m644 vmlinux' and 'ln -sr "${debugdir}/vmlinux"
"${builddir}/vmlinux"' so that modules built against
/usr/lib/modules/$KERNELRELEASE/build get split BTF. With =y that works.
With =m, Makefile.vmlinux strips .BTF from that vmlinux, and cmd_btf_ko
tests for build/vmlinux.unstripped, which nothing installs.

So every DKMS/out-of-tree module built against a pacman-pkg kernel with
=m (and DEBUG_INFO_BTF_MODULES, which defaults to y) is built without
.BTF, and the build still succeeds. The only sign is the stderr line
"Skipping BTF generation for foo.ko due to unavailability of vmlinux",
which is misleading because build/vmlinux is present; the missing file is
vmlinux.unstripped.

At runtime those modules have no BTF: fentry/fexit and BTF-typed tracing
of their functions are unavailable, and register_btf_kfunc_id_set() from
such a module falls into check_btf_kconfigs() ("missing module BTF,
cannot register kfunc"). This contradicts the changelog's "Nothing that
works with =y stops working" for the external-module flow the tree itself
packages.

Should scripts/package/PKGBUILD (and any other shipped build-tree layout)
provide vmlinux.unstripped when CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=m, or should
cmd_btf_ko use another base source? At minimum, the error message should
name $(btf-vmlinux) instead of saying "vmlinux".

With CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=m this strips .BTF from the vmlinux ELF file,
but the in-tree consumers that read the vmlinux BTF from that file were
not updated. Only Makefile.modfinal was switched to vmlinux.unstripped.

The tools pick their BTF source like this (tools/bpf/bpftool/Makefile):

  VMLINUX_BTF_PATHS ?= $(if $(O),$(O)/vmlinux)                   \
                       $(if $(KBUILD_OUTPUT),$(KBUILD_OUTPUT)/vmlinux) \
                       ../../../vmlinux                          \
                       /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux                   \
                       /boot/vmlinux-$(shell uname -r)
  VMLINUX_BTF ?= $(abspath $(firstword $(wildcard $(VMLINUX_BTF_PATHS))))
  ...
  $(OUTPUT)vmlinux.h: $(VMLINUX_BTF) $(BPFTOOL_BOOTSTRAP)
      $(QUIET_GEN)$(BPFTOOL_BOOTSTRAP) btf dump file $< format c > $@

$(wildcard) only checks that a file exists. In a tree where an =m kernel
was built, it selects the build-tree vmlinux, which now has no .BTF
section, and never reaches /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux. btf_parse_elf() in
tools/lib/bpf/btf.c then fails:

  if (!secs.btf_data) {
      pr_warn("failed to find '%s' ELF section in %s\n", BTF_ELF_SEC, path);
      err = -ENODATA;

do_dump() in bpftool reports "failed to load BTF from ...: No data
available" and the vmlinux.h rule fails. The same
VMLINUX_BTF_PATHS/firstword/wildcard logic followed by 'bpftool btf dump
file $(VMLINUX_BTF) format c' appears in
tools/testing/selftests/bpf/Makefile, tools/sched_ext/Makefile,
tools/testing/selftests/sched_ext/Makefile, samples/bpf/Makefile,
samples/hid/Makefile, drivers/hid/bpf/progs/Makefile and
tools/testing/selftests/hid/Makefile.

So after an =m kernel build, the default builds of bpftool (with
skeletons), the BPF selftests and the sched_ext tools fail unless
VMLINUX_BTF is overridden. With =y all of these work. This contradicts
the changelog's "Nothing that works with =y stops working". The Kconfig
help says tools "can use that [vmlinux.unstripped] or
/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux", but none of the in-tree tools do so by default.
No commit in the series touches tools/.

In-tree packaging has a related gap. scripts/package/PKGBUILD
_package-debug installs vmlinux and links it as build/vmlinux. With =y,
that is what Makefile.modfinal needs to generate BTF for external
modules. With =m, Makefile.modfinal looks for vmlinux.unstripped, which
is not packaged, and the packaged vmlinux no longer has .BTF. External
module BTF generation against those packages is therefore skipped. The
builddeb and kernel.spec debug vmlinux copies also no longer carry BTF.

Should VMLINUX_BTF_PATHS list vmlinux.unstripped before vmlinux, or
should the vmlinux ELF file keep the non-loadable .BTF?

The carrier module is recognized only when ELF_FILE contains a '/' before
btf_vmlinux.ko. That holds for normal and O= builds (ELF_FILE is
kernel/bpf/btf_vmlinux.ko). Does it hold for 'make M=kernel/bpf'?

Since the M= working-directory change, the top Makefile changes into the
module directory. scripts/Makefile.build then skips the $(obj)/ prefix
when obj is '.', so modules.order lists 'btf_vmlinux.o' and
Makefile.modfinal passes $@ = 'btf_vmlinux.ko'. 'module:btf_vmlinux.ko'
does not match 'module:*/btf_vmlinux.ko', so gen-btf.sh goes on to
gen_btf_data/embed_btf_data.

With CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF_MODULES=y the carrier gets its own split BTF
(plus a distilled .BTF.base, because KBUILD_EXTMOD adds --distill_base)
instead of a copy of the vmlinux BTF. Without BTF_MODULES,
Makefile.modfinal's matching '$(filter %/btf_vmlinux.ko,...)' also
misses, so the carrier gets no .BTF at all.

In both cases btf_vmlinux_module_coming() fails its check 'if
(mod->btf_data_size != btf_vmlinux_meta.size) { pr_err(...); return
-EINVAL; }', btf_module_notify() returns
notifier_from_errno(-EINVAL), and prepare_coming_module() makes the
module load fail.

After 'make M=kernel/bpf modules_install' the broken carrier goes to
$(MODLIB)/updates (Makefile.modinst: 'INSTALL_MOD_DIR ?= updates'), which
depmod searches ahead of kernel/ by default. request_module("btf_vmlinux")
from btf_vmlinux_data() then keeps loading the broken copy, and the
vmlinux BTF stays unavailable until that file is removed.

Could the match here (and the same in the Makefile.modfinal filter) cover
the bare name as well, e.g. 'module:btf_vmlinux.ko|module:*/btf_vmlinux.ko)'?
