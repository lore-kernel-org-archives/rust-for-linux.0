Well, this would indeed not be valid. However, a vmalloc allocater wouldn't
implement realloc() this way.

Or are you saying that Vec always uses the global allocator in that case? Why
would it do that?

Oh, indeed. I forgot about that when I wrote that. In that case I feel like it's
worth extending the existing allocator_api.

Thanks for for explaining.

I'd probably tend to extending allocator_api then. Do you see any major
advantages / disadvantages doing one or the other?

Sure, the above was just meant to see whether I understood you correctly.

Thanks for the hints - your assumptions are correct. The page flags are the same.
