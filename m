I just want to point out that there are ways of representing things like
the context you are running in during compile time.  I won't argue they
are necessarily practical, but there are ways and by exploring those
ways some practical solutions may result.

Instead of saying:
spin_lock(&lock);
do_something();
spin_unlock(&lock);

It is possible to say:
with_spin_lock(&lock, do_something());

This can be taken a step farther and with_spin_lock can pass a ``token''
say a structure with no members that disappears at compile time that
let's the code know it has the spinlock held.

In C I would do:
struct have_spin_lock_x {
	// nothing
};

do_something(struct have_spin_lock_x context_guarantee)
{
	...;
}

I think most of the special contexts in the kernel can be represented in
a similar manner.  A special parameter that can be passed and will
compile out.

I don't recall seeing anything like that tried in the kernel so I don't
know if it makes sense or if it would get too wordy to live, but it is
possible.  If passing a free context parameter is not too wordy it would
catch silly errors, and would hopefully leave more mental space for
developers to pay attention to the other details of the problems they
are solving.

*Shrug*  I don't know if rust allows for free parameters like that and
if it does I don't know if it would be cheap enough to live.

Eric
