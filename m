It is not about being a Rust zealot. I pointed out that your code has =
issues.
Every time you access the queue you have to use a special function =
because the
queue might be gone, how is this not a problem?

+ * However, there is a secondary hazard: a worker can be queued while =
the
+ * queue is in a "zombie" state =E2=80=94 refcount has already reached =
zero and async
+ * teardown is in flight, but the work item has not yet been disabled =
by
+ * free_work.  To guard against this every worker uses
+ * drm_dep_queue_get_unless_zero() at entry; if the refcount is already =
zero
+ * the worker bails immediately without touching the queue state.

At various points you document requirements that are simply comments. =
Resource
management is scattered all over the place, and it=E2=80=99s sometimes =
even shared
with drivers, whom you have no control over.

+ * Drivers that set %DRM_DEP_QUEUE_FLAGS_BYPASS_SUPPORTED and wish to
+ * serialise their own submit work against the bypass path must acquire =
this
+ * guard.  Without it, a concurrent caller of drm_dep_job_push() could =
take
+ * the bypass path and call ops->run_job() inline between the driver's
+ * eligibility check and its corresponding action, producing a race.

How is this not a problem? Again, you=E2=80=99re not in control of =
driver code.

+ * If set, the driver is responsible for freeing the job. If NULL,

Same here.

Even if we take Rust out of the equation, how do you plan to solve these =
things? Or
do you consider them solved as is?

I worry that we will find ourselves again at XDC in yet another =
scheduler
workshop to address the issues that will invariably come up with your =
new
design in a few years.

Note that I didn=E2=80=99t show up with a low-effort =E2=80=9Chey, how =
about we rewrite
this in Rust?=E2=80=9D. Instead, I linked to an actual Rust =
implementation that I
spent weeks painstakingly debugging, not to mention the time it took to =
write
it. Again, I suggest that you guys have a look, like I did with your =
code. You
might find things you end up liking there.=20
