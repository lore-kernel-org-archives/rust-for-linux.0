I think there's a bit a potential mess here because the conversion to
folios isn't far enough yet that we can entirely ignore page refcounts and
just use folio refcounts. But I guess we can deal with that oddity if we
hit it (maybe folio conversion moves fast enough), since this only really
starts to become relevant for hmm/svm gpu stuff.

iow I think anticipating the future where struct page really doesn't have
a refcount is the right move. Aside from that it's really not a refcount
that works in the rust ARef sense, since struct page cannot disappear for
system memory, and for dev_pagemap memory it's an entirely different
reference you need (and then there's a few more special cases).

For dma/iommu stuff there's also a push to move towards pfn + metadata
model, so that p2pdma doesn't need struct page. But I haven't looked into
that much yet.

Cheers, Sima
