I think we were talking about different things. :)

Zhi mentioned the private data of the parent device being used in fwctl
callbacks, but we should use private data stored in fwctl_device::dev inste=
ad.

Yes, in Rust you can't have an instance of a structure without initializing=
 it
(unless you put it in a MaybeUninit container, etc.).

For dynamic allocations Rust solves this with initializers. For instance, w=
here
C does:

	struct foo *foo =3D kzalloc(sizeof(*foo), GFP_KERNEL);

	/* Maybe broken if foo is used here already. */

	foo_initialize(foo, ...);

you'd have something like this in Rust:

	struct Foo {
	    data: Mutex<Data>,
	    index: u32,
	}

	impl Foo {
	    fn new(index: u32, args: Args) -> impl PinInit<Self, Error> {
	        try_pin_init!(Self {
	            data <- new_mutex!(args.to_data()?),
	            index.
	        })
	    }
	}

The returned object is not an instance of struct Foo yet, it is an initiali=
zer,
i.e. impl PinInit<Foo, Error>; no memory has been allocated yet. Note that =
this
initializer can also fail if executed, since args.to_data() can fail.

Let's allocate the memory now:

	let foo =3D KBox::pin_init(Foo::new(...), GFP_KERNEL)?;

This allocates the memory (i.e. KBox::pin_init() calls kmalloc() eventually=
) and
executes the initializer. (The call fails if either the memory allocation f=
ails,
or the initializer fails.) This way there is no way for the caller to use f=
oo
before it has been initialized.

(What about the "pin" thing? Let's assume Data contains something
self-referential, in this case pin-init does prevent the user from moving d=
ata
out of Foo, which would be a bug since it is a self-referential structure.
Actually, the mutex must not be moved either.)

Back to this abstraction. :)

In this case Registration::new() returns an initializer, but also allocates=
 the
C struct fwctl_device within the initializer.

AFAICS, _fwctl_alloc_device() already initializes the structure properly, s=
o it
seems there is nothing to be done. But let's assume there is. In this case =
it
wouldn't help much if we would create a separate fwctl::Device structure be=
fore,
as this one also has to be properly initialized once created. So the constr=
uctor
of fwctl::Device has to take the corresponding arguments.

Though, sometimes there are cases where we have to defer some initializatio=
n.
This is where we usually use separate types or type states. Let's assume
something in the device only ever gets initialized after registration for s=
ome
reason. In this case you could have a fwctl::Device<Unregistred> and a
fwctl::Device<Registered> and correspondingly treat the inner data as parti=
ally
uninitialized (which requires unsafe code).

Either way, I think it would be cleaner if fwctl::Device has a constructor

	impl Device<T> {
	    fn new(
	        parent: &Device<Bound>,
	        data: impl PinInit<T, Error>
	    ) -> Result<ARef<Self>>;
	}

where T is the driver's private data for the struct fwctl_device.

And Registration::new() can take a &fwctl::Device<T> and the parent
&Device<Bound> of course. This would also be in line with what we do in oth=
er
class device abstractions.
