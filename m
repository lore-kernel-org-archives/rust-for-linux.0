Yes, you are right. But it is still very minimal bits of logic. I
definitely want to encapsulate all SCSI logic in a single place now, so
it is more clear.

I cannot counter this argument without proof of existence. But I don't think
we will be anywhere near 15k lines extra to add these features.

I appreciate the input.

It may not make the ecosystem simpler at first, but I do believe it will
make the driver more simple.

It's a very small part though, so it should be fairly easy to manage. I
do acknowledge that our RFC driver has bits sprinkled about, and that
making it feature complete will make these bits grow. I don't think it
will grow as much as you hint at.

We did send this patch with the intention of starting this exact
conversation, so there is that. I appreciate your input that you would
prefer the conversation to be started in a different channel.

I am not sure what to read from this. I want to make it very clear that
this patch is not some kind of vibe coded pile of AI slop. I'd love to
discuss responsible and efficient use of LLMs for kernel work, but this
thread is not the place for that conversation.

Best regards,
