To me "points at a page" implies that the pointer is valid. I mean, if
it was dangling, it would not point at a page?

But I can reword to something else if you have a preferred phrasing.

Sure, that works for me.

I think it's a trade-off. That makes the code more error-prone, since
`pointer::add` now doesn't move by a number of bytes, but a number of
pages.

Like I said, the usual pointer rules apply. Two threads can access it
in parallel as long as one of the following are satisfied:

* Both accesses are reads.
* Both accesses are atomic.
* They access disjoint byte ranges.

Other than the fact that it uses a thread-local mapping on machines
that can't address all of their memory at the same time, it's
completely normal memory. It's literally just a PAGE_SIZE-aligned
allocation of PAGE_SIZE bytes.

I don't understand what you mean. It is the *most* raw API that `Page`
has. I can make them private if you want me to. The API cannot take
`&mut self` because I need to be able to unsafely perform concurrent
writes to disjoint byte ranges.
