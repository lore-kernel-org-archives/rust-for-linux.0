Yes.

Yes, it's really just encoding/decoding. Not much semantics or logic.

Please educate this fool then. I am curious what SCSI logic we would
spend years re-implementing in a detached ufshci driver.

On this I agree with you. The implementation language is not what we
should discuss.

In general I do not accept arguments that take shape along the lines of
"I have x YoE doing this, therefore I am right".

While it is possible that you are in fact on to something and that your
experience is the reason for this, it does not further the discussion. I
would much rather have you explain to me the reasoning behind your
expectations for this effort.

If it is "someone did it before and it did not work out" - who did it and why
did it not work out?

We have USB MSC as an example. I was not around back then. What
happened? Was their situation the same as it is for UFS? What scsi logic
did they try to implement in their driver that was a duplicate of scsi
midlayer? Surely it was not the 300 lines of command encoding/decoding
that made them fold?

At any rate, the rationale for extracting the UFS driver is to make room
for features that fit poorly into the SCSI midlayer and which are not
standardized in T10 - without making additional work for scsi subsystem
maintainers.

Best regards,
Andreas Hindborg
