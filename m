I think =E2=80=9Chereby=E2=80=9D reads a bit off here, but I am not a =

I think cycles are fine, if anything they make things live longer than =
intended
(possibly leaking them forever), but at no point they lead to UAFs. And =
for the
mem::forget() point, there seems to be precedent in other patches =
pointing to
unsafe constructors, where the safety requirement is basically "don't
mem::forget() this".

In fact, if you mem::forget() in the previous Arc approach, it seems =
like you leak
the context, while mem::forget() on the current solution does seem to =
allow UAF
by ending the borrow as you said yourself:

  let ctx =3D .... // FenceContext in some driver queue structure
  let fence =3D ctx.fence_alloc(...).new_fence() // DriverFence<'_, T> =
// borrows ctx
  mem::forget(fence); // ends the borrow
  drop(ctx); // DriverFenceData contains a dangling &FenceContext, and =
that allocation is managed by C

versus:

  let ctx: Arc<FenceCtx<...>> =3D ...;  // same as above, assume =
refcount=3D=3D1
  let fence =3D ctx.new_fence_allocation(..).new_fence(); // ctx =
refcount=3D=3D2
  mem::forget(fence); // ctx refcount=3D=3D2
  drop(ctx) //ctx refcount=3D=3D1

I noticed that you added a counter to catch the first case, but that =
assumes that
signaled fences won=E2=80=99t reach into the context anymore, IIUC? More =
on that below.

Why are we tracking the number of unsignaled fences, specifically? Is it =
not
possible for the C side (which controls the actual allocation) to reach =
back
into the Rust side via the callbacks even after the context drops, =
regardless
of their signaled status?

And in any case, even side stepping this signaled vs unsignaled dilemma =
that
this counter is trying to check, the end result seems to be "sorry, you =
misused
the API and now a UAF is possible". In this specific sense, it doesn't =
sound
that much better than what we are trying to move away from in C.

The more I think about this borrow design, the more I believe a simple =
refcount
would be way safer. I mean, this field would go away to begin with, =
IIUC, and
that=E2=80=99s not even considering the point above.

Can we get rid of the =E2=80=9Cget=E2=80=9D prefix here? I hardly see =
=E2=80=9Cget=E2=80=9D in Rust accessors.

We don=E2=80=99t need to shorten methods and types IMHO. We can just say
=E2=80=9Cnew_allocation=E2=80=9D or a some other variation without =

Is this new? Needs a bit more documentation.

OTOH I think we shouldn=E2=80=99t come up with a new guard type. IIRC =
from
Lyude=E2=80=99s et al previous work, there=E2=80=99s already a way to =
build a Rust lock
from a C lock (Lock::from_raw()). In fact, I think this whole =
implementation
can boil down to:

pub fn lock(&self) -> SpinLockIrqGuard<=E2=80=98_, ()> {
  let ptr =3D unsafe {bindings::dma_fence_spinlock(=E2=80=A6)};
  unsafe { SpinLockIrq::<()>::from_raw(ptr)}.lock()
}

This has a few advantages:=20

a) doesn=E2=80=99t introduce its own guard type, instead reusing =
something that was
previously tested,

b) you get the right behavior with the included NotThreadSafe token.

c) the guard is now borrowed. Your guard is owned, which can easily lead =
to UB
because the lifetime is detached from the &self that originated it.
