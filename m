Surely you can expect maintainers of the Rust abstraction to help with
integrating API changes -- this isn't different compared to driver / component
maintainers helping with integrating fundamental API changes for their affected
driver / component, like you've mentioned videobuf2-dma stuff.

At last year's LPC I held a talk [1] about Rust in the kernel and there was a
question at the end where I was asked how I think about cases where Rust
abstraction break caused C API changes.

My answer was that I'm not too concerned about this. We can just rely on what
already happens every day in kernel development: people work together and
collaborate. There are a lot of very core components that are widely used and
depending on the complexity of the change may require the help of the users to
integrate changes. So, I don't think with Rust abstractions we're adding
anything that the kernel does not already has a strategy to deal with.
