 From my limited experience with Rust, things like these are a bit 
annoying indeed, sooner or later Mutex<> just doesn't cut it and you 
have to deal with its limitations.

In this particular case you would use an AtomicBool field, place it 
outside the Mutex-protected struct, and make sure that is only accessed 
under the lock just like in C.
One easy way out is to make the Mutex protect (officially) nothing, i.e. 
Mutex<()>, and handle the mutable fields yourself using RefCell (which 
gives you run-time checking but has some some space cost) or UnsafeCell 
(which is unsafe as the name says).  Rust makes it pretty easy to write 
smart pointers (Mutex<>'s lock guard itself is a smart pointer) so you 
also have the possibility of writing a safe wrapper for the combination 
of Mutex<()> and UnsafeCell.

Another example is when yu have a list of XYZ objects and use the same 
mutex for both the list of XYZ and a field in struct XYZ.  You could 
place that field in an UnsafeCell and write a function that receives a 
guard for the list lock and returns the field, or something like that. 
It *is* quite ugly though.

As an aside, from a teaching standpoint associating a Mutex with a 
specific data structure is bad IMNSHO, because it encourages too 
fine-grained locking.  Sometimes the easiest path to scalability is to 
use a more coarse lock and ensure that contention is extremely rare. 
But it does work for most simple use cases (and device drivers would 
qualify as simple more often than not).
