Perhaps on the structured aspect but I don't see how tools/ differs from
scripts/ with regards to MAINTAINERS entries. Yeah, Kbuild has a
scripts/ catch all but you could still add a top level folder and add
that to whatever MAINTAINERS entry you want.

Which is a recent change, no?

Well, the only reason I bring that up is that it will make life harder
on the Kbuild people to do treewide audits and reviews of Kbuild usage
when certain areas in tools/ use Kbuild while others don't. Obviously,
we can adapt should the general consensus want tools to live in tools/.
