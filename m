How about "not everyone uses a browser as a part of their workflow"?
I realize that it might sound ridiculous for folks who spent a while
around Mozilla, but it's really true and kernel community actually
has quite a few of such freaks.  And as one of those freaks I can tell
you where exactly I would like you to go and what I would like you to do
with implicit suggestions to start a browser when I need to read some
in-tree documentation.

Linus might have different reasons, obviously.
