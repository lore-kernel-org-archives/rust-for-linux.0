To back up Sima here, we don't need grandstanding, brigading, playing
to the crowd, streamer drama creation or any of that in discussions
around this.

The r4l team and drm maintainer team have this sort of thing in hand,
it's not like we don't understand the community of the Linux kernel,
and having this first reaction to blow shit up and dramatise it just
isn't helpful.

Being toxic on the right side of an argument is still toxic, please
try and be better, and maybe take a step back and consider is what you
are posting going to help the discussion or just adding pointless
drama to it.

Dave.
