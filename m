Of course it is going to be better with IoSlice, but limiting the number of
unsafe calls regardless is a bit pointless if the "safe" ones can cause
undefined behavior. :)

I don't even know if we want them to be temporary, i.e. we can copy right a=
way
and IoSlice would still be an improvement in order to make the copy in the =
first
place.

Also, you say "no-copy", but that's not true, we do copy eventually. In fac=
t,
the whole point of this patch is to copy this buffer into a KVVec.

So, why not copy it right away with dma_read!() (later replaced with an IoS=
lice
copy) and then process it further?

I am also very sceptical of the "holding on to the reference prevents the r=
ead
pointer update" argument. Once we have a copy, there is no need not to upda=
te
the read pointer anymore in the first place, no?

Not pretty (which is of course not on you :), but looks correct.

I still feel like we should just copy right away, as mentioned above.
