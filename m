I don't really see much value in this intermediate change; it's not really =
less
invasive than to do the refactor I think, so let's do that.

Yes, that'd be best.

I think this is fine if, as Alex says as well, we expose it as another vari=
ant
of subregion(). (In general, I'd like to avoid introducing more build_asser=
t!()
if there's not much value though.)

In the nova-core case it would be a specific workaround for generic_const_e=
xprs
not being stable, so a separate subregion() variant that is specifically
targeted at this seems fine.

As mentioned I'd like to avoid additional build_assert!() if not needed, th=
e
turbofish doesn't hurt too much here.

I may have a slight preference for a separate subregion() variant for the
purpose of working around generic_const_exprs, as it probably is a bit clos=
er to
the final solution, but trait methods are fine with me too.
