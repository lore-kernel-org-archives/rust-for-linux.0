The problem with the bindings in Wedson's FS slides is that it's
really unreasonable to expect C programmers to understand them.  In my
opinion, it was not necessarily a wise decision to use bindings as
hyper-complex as a way to convince C developers that Rust was a net
good thing.

I do understand (now) what Wedson was trying to do, was to show off
how expressive and powerful Rust can be, even in the face of a fairly
complex interface.  It turns out there were some good reasons for why
the VFS handles inode creation, but in general, I'd encourage us to
consider whether there are ways to change the abstractions on the C
side so that:

   (a) it makes it easier to maintain the Rust bindings, perhaps even
       using automatically generation tools,
   (b) it allows Rust newbies having at least some *hope* of updating
       the manually maintained bindings,
   (c) without causing too much performance regressions, especially
       on hot paths, and
   (d) hopefully making things easier for new C programmers from
       understanding the interface in question.

So it might not be that increasing C safety isn't the primary goal, in
general, one of the ways that we evaluate a particular patchset is
whether addresses multiple problems at the same time.  If it does,
that's a signal that perhaps it's the right direction for us to go.

Cheers,
