That right there is really good news. If we can add that script to the
tests in bcachefs-tools, we'll already be in better shape than we were.

I wonder if it would be possible to upstream that check into bindgen.

Also, note: the differing alignment isn't a correctness issue, but it is
definitely a performance issue on arm - the compiler will then have to
generate code to handle misaligned loads and stores.

Agreed. It'd be great to have an easy way of checking member offsets as
well, like we were discussing on IRC, but I don't think it's necessary.

That feels right to me; and if we can get your test committed I won't be
too concerned about getting a formal proof :)

Thanks for the writeup, this really helps.

Agreed that if at all possible we should aim for better support from
rustc, and forwarding this to the rustc people might help get this the
necessary attention before we dive in with patching bindgen.

Another thought - the interface between bindgen and rustc feels a bit
fragile here, since the C attributes and Rust reprs don't exactly match.
Can we come up with something better?

I wonder if we could get support in rustc for specifying the offset of
each member directly?

Also - you tracked down the difference between microsoft and gcc
__attribute__((align)), let me try to recap (and tell me if I get it
wrong): with gcc, __align() works like any naturally aligned type, but
Microsoft's version overrides __packed on a containing structure.

I think there's a strong argument to be made that Microsoft is the weird
one here and Rustc should just provide the gcc behaviour when mixing
packed and align...
