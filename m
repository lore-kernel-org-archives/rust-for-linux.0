In general I agree; and I think I also brought it up a few times that it wo=
uld
be nice to avoid making GEM objects generic over the DeviceContext.

But now that we already have it (and it is out of the way with this patch
already), I think it could make sense to wait a bit and see how the TTM stu=
ff
turns out before we go back and forth (I think it may be useful there)?

At least I'd prefer to do this in a follow-up patch and, if required, discu=
ss it
there. Do you mind sending a follow-up patch, given that you already looked=
 into
removing it entirely?
