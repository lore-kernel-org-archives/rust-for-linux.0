Why? The kernel already has the information, so we don't need a lookup tabl=

If the kernel can't figure out the architecture of a card, it means that th=
e
chip isn't known by the kernel. Without that, how can it boot the firmware,
etc.?

If the kernel can't deal with a chip it should never succeed probing and ne=
ver
expose any information to userspace in the first place.

nova-core does enforce this already; if a chipid can't be matched against a=
n
architecture it won't compile, and if the chipid is not known by nova-core =
it
will fail to probe.

Note that nova-core binds by vendor + class, not specific PCI device IDs, s=
o the
chipset check is our only gate against unknown hardware.

If we'd hypothetically remove that gate and just allow trying to probe unkn=
own
hardware with the boot sequence of just assuming some default with the late=
st
supported architecture, it would potentially be an even worse user experien=
ce,
where instead of a clear rejection of the hardware a user might experience
security/stability issues.

I still don't see much value in letting userspace decode this again, nor do=
 I
think lookup tables are necessary.

If the driver succeeds to probe for a device we already did decode things, =
so
there's no need for userspace to do it again or know about this.
