I mean hotunplug here, and trying to make that correct.

This confusion is is why this is so hard, because there's really two main
users for all this:

- developers who want to quickly test new driver versions without full
  reboot. They're often preferring convenience over correctness, like with
  the removal of module refcounting that's strictly needed but means they
  first have to unbind drivers in sysfs before they can unload the driver.

  Another one is that this use-case prefers that the hw is cleanly shut
  down, so that you can actually load the new driver from a well-known
  state. And it's entirely ok if this all fails occasionally, it's just
  for development and testing.

- hotunplug as an actual use-case. Bugs are not ok. The hw can go away at
  any moment. And it might happen while you're holding console_lock. You
  generally do not remove the actual module here, which is why for the
  actual production use-case getting that part right isn't really
  required. But getting the lifetimes of all the various
  structs/objects/resources perfectly right is required.

So the "stuck on console_lock" is the 2nd case, not the first. Module
unload doesn't even come into play on that one.

Rust's drop takes care of that for you. It's not guaranteed, but it's a
case of "the minimal amount of typing yields correct code", unlike C,
where that just blows up for sure.

Hence why I want revocable to only be rcu, not srcu.

Yeah this one is a bit scary. Corrupting the state is doable, locking up
is much less likely I think, it seems to be more leaks that you get if
rust goes wrong.

Yeah agreed. I might really badly regret this all. But I'm not sold that
switching to message passing design is really going to be better, while
it's definitely going to be a huge amount of work.

Maybe the two different use-cases above help explain why I'm a bit more
pragmatic here. As long as the hotunplug case does not gain bugs (or gets
some fixed) I'm fairly lax with hacks for the driver developer use-case of
reloading modules.

You could do contrived stuff and pass function pointers around, so that
THIS_MODULE doesn't actually match up with the function pointer. Sure it's
really stupid, but the idea with rust is that for memory safety stuff like
this, it's not just stupid, but impossible and the compiler will catch
you. So we need a tad more for rust.

Yeah this is again where I think rust needs a bit more, because the
compiler can't always nicely proof this for you in all the "obvious"
cases.
