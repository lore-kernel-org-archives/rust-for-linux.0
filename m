Good catch,

That reminds me that I'd like to have a table in Documentation/gpu/nova/ li=
sting
and explaining all abbreviations.

In nouveau it's a huge mess and all the abbreviations became rather confusi=
ng.

I think we already have a couple unexplained ones in nova-core, such as ACR
(Authenticated Code RAM), if that is even correct. :)

Besides that I think it would also be nice to have a basic graphs of the
different boot sequences in the documentation as well, including the differ=
ent
firmware images and the purpose they serve, including sub-components.

For instance, I think we never mention where ACR lives (SEC2 before Hopper,
GSP-FMC since Hopper), if I got that correct.

We already have something is fsp.rst, but I think it is misleading and need=
s to
be fixed as well.

This reads as if FMC runs on FSP and FMC (running on the FSP) subsequently =
loads
GSP-RM. Maybe it should be fixed by this patch, as it is the exact same mis=
take
this patch addresses.
