I really would like to see some docs of that, I didn't find anything in
the reference, official docs, or nomicon. The reference does say [1]
that:

    `dyn Trait` metadata must be a pointer to a compiler-generated
    vtable for Trait. (For raw pointers, this requirement remains a
    subject of some debate.)

Do you know where it was decided? I did find this [2] UCG issue that
covers it, but that doesn't seem like the decision, just the discussion.

Well size_of_val_raw is `unsafe` and only valid to call in certain
conditions. It asks in the case of slices that the length is an
initialized integer and that the entire value must fit into `isize`.
This to me just further indicates that `*mut T` has safety
requirements to obtaining the size of an arbitrary pointer.

In the special cases of `T: Sized` and `T =3D=3D [U]`, we have safe ways of
getting their size.

Cheers,
Benno
