What about module symbol namespaces?

And this will happen more as we have more bindings from subsystem rust
code that should not be exported directly to modules/drivers to allow
them to access those symbols without going through the rust core.

Also, again, module symbol namespaces will play here, think about a
driver calling a symbol in another driver's namespace, that has within
it a call to a different namespace.  That first driver would then have
to "import" that last namespace, which isn't ok.
