The reason we need Wolfram and I2C folk in the discussion here is
the 'richness' of how the I2C spec is used.

I'll go a little further.  If this was renamed to make it the rust smbus
binding them I wouldn't be as bothered by this. For something claiming to
be I2C this is a misleading interface and I am very much against it.
Doing this is a path to a lot of confusion and problems for extensibility.

Maybe less than 50% of I2C devices use smbus calls (or at least in IIO,
it might be more standard elsewhere). That is partly because almost no
one uses that naming on datasheets so not everyone notices that they
can use them - this is also the reason the byte swapped variant is very
common - if you look at the I2C spec and implement auto increment on
addressing, then the byte order is a random choice.  A substantial
set of devices use a register style interface but due to subtle
protocol differences cannot use smbus.

Also perhaps relevant to this: If you'd submitted the driver in this
series as a c driver, you would have been asked the question: "why aren't
you using regmap".  It brings a rich set of helpers, standarized caching
etc.  The answer that applies here of the regmap binding isn't ready
isn't a great way to answer that question!

Just sticking to byte and word reads, see the c. 7 different options in
regmap.  Given this is the I2C binding (not Smbus) one you've picked one
random choice from that set.  Also note there are other custom i2c regmap
implementations in drivers to cover the long tail of 'other' ways of doing
register access.

Understood that there is more to do, but given the regmap already encapsulates
the smbus support you have here, I'd be much more in favour of the focus
going on getting that done.  We will need i2c bindings as well but that
will be for the many devices that aren't register based etc for which this
trait approach is wrong.  I would almost suggest not merging a non regmap
interface for what you cover here, except we do get annoying corner cases
where the device uses a mixture of smbus like commands and non smbus so there
probably will need to be support at the i2c / smbus level.

I understood that - but to me it seems to be irrelevant.

Agreed.

I'm still lost. The address must <= 128 to fit in the available 7 bits.
Why would you let it be bigger than that? It's going in a 7 bit field
not the byte that contains that field.

Is this separating a safety argument from a bug check?  If so why
not just use the tighter one?
