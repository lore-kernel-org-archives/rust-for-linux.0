Yes, those structures are not even exposed to the nova-core layers we are
dealing with here.

There are the structures abstracting firmware interfaces, but despite expos=
ing
trivial cached values, they should not exposed to nova-drm either.

Instead nova-drm should call into nova-core and ask it to do things on its
behalf.

More in general, the same is true for any other device resources. For insta=
nce,
we also should not expose the pci::Device or the pci::Bar to nova-drm, but =
again
provide a higher level API.

We could indeed expose all values from struct Gpu directly and control
everything through visibility, but ...

... exposing struct Gpu and controlling everything through visibility still
means that we could easily miss some device resource being exposed directly=
 to
nova-drm, which also includes GSP abstractions.

So, I think we should provide accessors for the major structures that we
intentionally want to expose (so we have an obvious boundary), but not for =
every
single fields inside them.

This is also why I said that we can expose an accessor for struct Spec, whi=
ch I
think serves as a good example.
