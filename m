I understand the feeling. One thing I can say about the abstractions we've been
talking about is that they're zero-cost. So you'd still have the ability to
inspect generated code and relate that to source, although it would still be
subject to optimisations like C (or perhaps more optimisations as the compiler
knows more about the code).

This may indeed be the case. But I'd invite you to try it out for yourself
anyway before discounting it. I used to hate destructors in C++ because they
were called implicitly: C was king because I had full control. Now I find myself
publicly backing Rust. I feel the advantages outweigh the cost.

Thank you. I also appreciate your willingness to engage with us.
