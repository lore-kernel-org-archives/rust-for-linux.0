I'm not sure there's a need to worry about overhead in this hypothetical
case if the dispatcher is merely a translator and doesn't validate inputs,
copy buffers, or such. It would be less than calling from userspace.

What I meant to say (I wasn't clear before) was for this solution to apply
to cases where maintainers are firmly against all alternatives. Obviously,
if all the parties involved are happy, direct bindings are preferable.

I'm not sure there's a need to worry about overhead in this hypothetical
case if the dispatcher is merely a translator and doesn't validate inputs,
copy buffers, or such. It would be less than calling from userspace.

What I meant to say (and wasn't clear before) is that this solution could
apply to cases where maintainers are firmly against all better
alternatives. Of course, if all the parties involved are happy with direct
bindings, that's preferable. But as you said, this is a social problem, so
maybe it's not a one-size-fits-all solution.

I agree that in some cases, abstracting the API could be complicated, but
I’d focus on keeping it simple and providing Rust with the minimum subset
it needs to keep things moving forward. Abdiel's PR is a good example --
by keeping the functions in his CoherentAllocation, we keep that option,
but lose the granularity of DMA mapping attributes (which would be some
default in the C dispatcher).

I agree that making subtle API changes is risky, and it would def. be
something to keep an eye on.

And yes, with this approach, some Rust developers may eventually miss
certain DMA functionalities in the future; but that would still be better
than the current situation, where _all_ Rust devs are missing all DMA
capabilities.
