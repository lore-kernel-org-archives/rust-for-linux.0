rust: net: phy: pass a MaybeLocked device to soft_reset and match_phy_device

This patch changes the Rust PHY abstraction so that the soft_reset and
match_phy_device callbacks receive a &Device<MaybeLocked> instead of a
Locked device. It also corrects the SAFETY comments that said PHYLIB holds
phy_device->lock for these callbacks. ax88796b_rust is updated to the new
signature.

[Severity: Low]
Is this accurate for match_phy_device? Its only caller is phy_bus_match(),
and that never holds phydev->lock:

drivers/net/phy/phy_device.c:phy_bus_match() {
    ...
	if (phydrv->match_phy_device)
		return phydrv->match_phy_device(phydev, phydrv);
    ...
}

The new SAFETY comment in match_phy_device_callback() further down in this
patch says "phy_bus_match() holds no PHY lock". So the type doc and the
callback's SAFETY comment describe the same callback differently.

Could the doc say that soft_reset is called both with and without the lock,
and match_phy_device always without it?

[Severity: High]
Is this conversion complete? read_mmd_callback() and write_mmd_callback()
in rust/kernel/net/phy.rs still say "This callback is called only in
contexts where we hold phy_device->lock", and they still build a Locked
device:

rust/kernel/net/phy.rs:Adapter::read_mmd_callback() {
    ...
            let dev = unsafe { Device::from_raw(phydev) };
            // CAST: the C side verifies devnum < 32.
            let ret = T::read_mmd(dev, devnum as u8, regnum)?;
    ...
}

phy_read_mmd() and phy_write_mmd() take only the MDIO bus lock. Then
__phy_read_mmd() and __phy_write_mmd() dispatch to the driver:

drivers/net/phy/phy-core.c:__phy_read_mmd() {
    ...
	if (phydev->drv && phydev->drv->read_mmd)
		return phydev->drv->read_mmd(phydev, devad, regnum);
    ...
}

<C45 as Register>::read() and write() in rust/kernel/net/phy/reg.rs are
now generic over PhyContext. That means the new MaybeLocked soft_reset can
get back to a Locked device:

phy_attach_direct() or phy_mii_ioctl()   (no phydev->lock)
  phy_init_hw()
    drv->soft_reset()
      soft_reset_callback()
        T::soft_reset(&Device<MaybeLocked>)
          dev.read(C45::new(...))
            phy_read_mmd()               (MDIO bus lock only)
              __phy_read_mmd()
                read_mmd_callback()
                  T::read_mmd(&mut Device<Locked>)

>From there, T::read_mmd() can call start_aneg(), set_speed(),
set_duplex() and so on without phy_device->lock, racing with
phy_state_machine(). The commit message says a soft_reset can no longer
reach these Locked-only operations. This path also creates a &mut Device
that aliases the still-live &Device<MaybeLocked>.

The series also opens a second lock-less entry. Before the series,
match_phy_device got only &Device and could not call read() or write(),
which took &mut self. Now it can issue C45 reads. On an already-bound
device, those go to the bound Rust driver's read_mmd_callback() with no
lock held.

The Locked type doc says PHYLIB holds phy_device->lock for every callback
except probe, suspend, resume and the MaybeLocked ones. That would also be
wrong for read_mmd and write_mmd.

No in-tree Rust PHY driver implements read_mmd or write_mmd today, so
nothing triggers this yet.

Should read_mmd and write_mmd also move to a MaybeLocked-style context?

[Severity: High]
Can safe code in a Rust match_phy_device dereference a NULL phydev->drv
here? Device::read_paged() is now a &self method for every context, so a
match_phy_device implementation can call it on &Device<MaybeLocked>:

Device::read_paged()
  phy_read_paged()
    phy_select_page()
      phy_save_page()
        phy_lock_mdio_bus()
        __phy_read_page()

drivers/net/phy/phy-core.c:__phy_read_page() {
	if (WARN_ONCE(!phydev->drv->read_page, "read_page callback not available, PHY driver not loaded?\n"))
    ...
}

match_phy_device runs from phy_bus_match() before phy_probe() sets
phydev->drv = phydrv. phydev is allocated zeroed, and phy_remove() resets
drv to NULL.

So for an unbound PHY, this would oops with the MDIO bus mdio_lock held.
Every other PHY on that bus would then hang.

This wasn't reachable before the series: read_paged() took &mut self, and
match_phy_device only got &Device. The previous patch, "rust: net: phy:
make Device generic over a lock context", made read_paged() a &self method
for all contexts, and this patch makes MaybeLocked the match_phy_device
context.

The read_paged() SAFETY comment ("just an FFI call") also does not cover
the requirement of phy_read_paged() that phydev->drv is non-NULL.

C drivers that need paged access during match open-code the page select
instead, for example rtlgen_supports_2_5gbps() in
drivers/net/phy/realtek/realtek_main.c.

Should read_paged() be limited to contexts where phydev->drv is known to
be set, or should match_phy_device get a narrower context?
