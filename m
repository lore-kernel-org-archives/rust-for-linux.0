Indeed, FWIW it seems like the appropriate level of abstraction to me, 
judging by the other wrappers living in rust/kernel/ already. As far as 
the interaction with C code goes, it appears to be a pretty 
straightforward midlayer consumer of the DMA API much like others we 
already have (e.g. videobuf2-dma-*), just one which happens to be a 
language binding rather than some other kind of functional abstraction.

There is a realistic chance that the C API will evolve in ways which 
break the binding, but as long as a) that won't break non-Rust builds, 
and b) Rust folks are happy to take responsibility for un-breaking the 
Rust build if and when it happens, then that seems reasonable IMO.

Thanks,
Robin.
