It's possible that many of the questions you've been specifically asking
about, by sheer coincidence, are targeted towards the problems that would
indeed require a lower-level abstraction built within an unsafe block; meaning
you've managed to evade the tons of other upper layers that could be written
in safe Rust.

Indeed, at a certain layer, unsafe is unavoidable for the kind of work that
is done in the kernel. The goal is to shrink the unsafe blocks as much as
possible and confirm the correctness of those pieces, then build safe
abstractions on top of it.

For what it's worth, if there was some post-human apocalyptic world where
literally everything had to go inside an unsafe block, the silver lining
in a hypothetical situation like this is that unsafe does not disable all
of Rust's static analysis like the borrow checker, etc. It allows you to
do things like directly dereference a pointer, etc. Unsafe also doesn't
automatically mean that the code is wrong or that it has memory issues;
it just means that the compiler can't guarantee that it doesn't based on
what you do in the unsafe block.
