Well, I aggressively stripped all the commits that had a bad RoI on that.

And a lot of these are additive over 21 commits.

So, unfortunately, hacking away at what seem like low cost commits will eat
away at the overall result.

I really did work hard to cut the fat where I could, believe me going
through what remained and a. figuring out what it did, b. rewriting a lot
of the code and c. rewriting commit messages (ahem ;) was NOT fun :)

So I was happy to swing the axe as it saved me in terms of what little
sanity remains ;)

I tried a CONFIG_LTO_CLANG_THIN in order to check that the *.mod.S stuff
worked correctly, all working correctly.

I can try to get some profiling numbers for thin and full if you want?

Well I rewrote the majority of them, so this is a stinging critique of my
commit message writing I guess :)

I mean no, I did write nearly all of them. So I guess err... yeah :)

The testing results and perf numbers are generated and maybe I missed some
bits but generally this is so.

Anyway, I am known to be critical on-list on occasion, so if you dish it
out you have to take it - if you point out specific commit messages that
need work then I can try to put commit msgs on a diet :)

(N.B. I have had feedback like that on a fair few human-written commit
messages of mine lately so there might be some validity to that ;)

"going from three passes to one would save around 8s on an allmodconfig
build and 2 to 3s on defconfig, out of tails that are currently roughly 25s
and 8s." says the LLM :) so that actually does seem worthwhile.

But I think best as a follow up?

I'd like to land the really low-hanging fruit before maybe digging in to
what else we can cut out :)
