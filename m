Ah, nice! I will certainly have a look when it's out. Thanks for the
heads-up.

So, gpuvm is one level up (it doesn't deal at all with any HW
representation), but I guess we could provide helpers for UMA-GPUs,
where preparing the page table on the CPU is a thing, and it could be
that MSM would be interested in using those helpers too.

I'll let Alice decide, but I'm perfectly fine with both options
(NOP default with a disclaimer, or no default at all).

Thanks,
