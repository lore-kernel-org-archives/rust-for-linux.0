I had a half written email on this but you two already covered much of it
and discussion is heading where I was going anyway :)

For native / CMA:

I agree that the kernel 'should' check the signature in the final
challenge/auth message so as to validate the whole flow was valid.
Fine to leave cert checking to userspace - that was earlier in
the flow anyway.  I'd also like it to do sanity checks on the cert
chain (for internal consistency and the few requirements PCI puts
on the leaf cert), some of which it needs to do to pull the public
key out of the leaf anyway. I think that's all cheap stuff to
detect failures early.

As far as I can tell, the signature check isn't strictly necessary
as userspace has all the info to do that signature check on the
transcript.  Bit of nasty parsing code but not particularly bad and
likely to be in tooling anyway for debug purposes. (I'm assuming that's
why there is a 'probably' above :)

We only _need_ the kernel to check the signature (in challenge/auth)
for the (future) recovery flow.

As Alastair's rust demonstrates though it's low cost in terms
of complexity to ensure internal consistency. I'm assuming
the various TSMs are doing similar?

Anyhow, all that really says is I'd like the internal consistency of
the SPDM session checking in now.  Leave checking we actually trust
the cert + measurements to user space (and all the stuff below
on recovery comes later).

Agreed it'll be something along those lines.

So far all sounds good to me.
