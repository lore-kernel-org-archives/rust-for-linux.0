We can't always enforce things, but we can still follow rules even if we can't
enforce them with tools or language features.

In particular, nothing prevents C code to define from which context things are
allowed to be called. When I was working on drm_gpuvm [1] this was one of the
major aspects I had to get right and documented; keyword dma_fence signalling
critical sections.

The language documentation defines `Send` as "can be transferred between
threads", likely because it's written from a userspace perspective. But in
the kernel context it actually means can be transferred between any context,
thread, IRQ, etc.

If this isn't true, then we have to add a comment what is allowed (e.g. any
non-atomic context) and what's not allowed.

That'd be great, but as mentioned above, we only have `Send`, but nothing like
`SendIrq`, hence `Send` really means any context.

Given your proposal, to just say it's fine to pass between (actual) threads and
ignore IRQ context for now, we have to implement `Send`, but document that IRQ
context is not covered.

We can either do that in the Rust abstraction as safety requirement, or we can,
as proposed previously, add a comment to the C `struct device` documentation
that implementers of release() must *at least* make sure that it can be called
from any non-atomic context. We can then refer to that.
