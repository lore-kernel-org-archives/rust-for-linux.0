lockdep doesn't need to store per-page information.  Possibly DEPT
doesn't either.

lockdep needs one lockdep_map for each lock class.  It would make sense
for all folio locks to use the same global lockdep_map.

Each specific lock is known to lockdep as a task which holds the lock, a
lockdep_map which represents the class of locks, and subclass number
which allows a given task to hold multiple locks of the same class
providing it declare (e.g. with spin_lock_nested() etc).

Yes and no....

lockdep has no knowledge of control flows moving across threads in the
way that I assume DEPT does.  But it should be possible to tell it.

If you have some code that takes a lock and then hands it off to
another thread, at the hand-off point you call
   lock_map_release(&the_lock_map)

This says "no task owns this lock any more".

maybe you put the folio which is locked on a queue or an lru or
whatever.

There is no way to say "that queue owns this lock".  Maybe that could
usefully be added - assuming coherent semantics can be designed.

Somewhere else some other task takes responsibility for that folio and
the lock.  maybe it dequeues a page, or maybe an lru callback gives the
locked page to some code.
That code then calls
   lock_map_acquire_try(&the_lock_map)

This says "this task is now holding this lock" (or more accurately "now
holding a lock of this class").
Note the "_try" - that says that the task didn't have to wait for the
lock, it just got it for free, which in fact it did.

Now if that task takes some other lock, lockdep will see a dependency
between the page lock and the new lock, and will accept or reject it as
you would expect.

So you definitely *can* send lock dependency information between tasks
with lockdep.  I have only tried it in extremely simple cases where a
single object is being locked by one task and unlocked by another - no
queues or lists.
There may be - and probably are - more complexities involved with
locking folios and passing them around.  Maybe it is so complex that you
need all the support that DEPT provides.  But I'd like to see a coherent
explanation of how the functionality offered by DEPT is clearly better.
