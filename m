Yes, the kernel's conduct is still not where I think it needs to be. And
there are still cases occuring with some regularity which would be
unacceptable on dri-devel and sanctioned under the freedesktop.org code of
conduct. But that's not really new, it's not really specific to the r4l
project, and despite that it's still not good enough, it's definitely much
better than 10 years ago.

That all aside, I put the "outsized" very intentionally in my comment. It
carries a lot more than just the above paragraph in just one small word.

I got seriously annoyed with you about two years ago for the first time,
but kept chatting for quite a while longer. Nothing changed. Like I said,
I'm not complaining about this specific case here, but about a pattern
that you've established consistently over a fair amount of time.

And if you're wondering why you didn't realize this: It's impossible to
change people by telling them they're wrong. What does tend to work is
explaining different perspectives, so that they can figure it out
themselves. And sometimes that's just way too subtle to ever register.

I wasn't fully awake yet this morning, but I have no issue standing behind
that thread in it's entirety. Lightly edited for typos below, with one
sentence added for a bit more context:

This isn't about "being civil" or "friendly" and even less about "don't
call out". This is about calling out in an ineffective and imprecise way,
so that the people actually trying to change things are busy patching up
your collateral damage instead of implementing real changes, while all
you've achieved is airing your frustration for internet drama points.

Aside from that I've learned through private feedback since my first mail
here that your social media brigading has had much more of a chilling
effect on contributors than I assumed, which is not acceptable.

When you're that harmful with your calling out, eventually I'm going to be
fed up, and you get a live round shot across your bow. And if that then
causes you to ragequit, because you can't actually deal with the heat
you've been dishing out coming back around the corner:

Fuck off.

Or as Dave Airlie put it upthread in this conversation:

"Being toxic on the right side of an argument is still toxic, [...]"

So please do call out broken things, do change things, I've been doing it
for well over a decade in the linux kernel. But do it in a way that you're
not just becoming part of the problem and making it bigger.

I'm really not in favor of chiding people for how they earn money, because
this world isn't fair and critizing people for how they get their bills
paid is generally not ok. But this is a bit too much to just let it slide.

It's fairly plausible that you need the social media brigading to generate
attention that you can convert into enough donations to support the asahi
project. But someone has to clean up the mess your shitstorms create, it's
sure not you, which means my and other people's mental health essentially
pay your bills. And I really do not appreciate that dynamic.

Cheers, Sima
