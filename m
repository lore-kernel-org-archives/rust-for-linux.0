Sure, adding this to the list sounds good.

Not too sure what you mean here. Are you saying that we should fork
io-pgtable-arm.c (or rather a subset of it), and have it all
implemented in panthor? I actually asked Rob if that was a good way to
go when rolling out the initial panthor version, and he advised me
against it. Now, I see good reasons to do that, like the fact we
would be able to add features like batched repeat mapping updates
(mapping the same page over a wide virtual range without having to
duplicate the intermediate page table levels that are exactly the
same), or the ability to extend the mapping arguments with
shareability/coherency info (that we can do by adding IOMMU_xx flags
too). But there's also downsides to it, like the fact we wouldn't
benefit from bugfixes materializing in io-pgtable-arm.c, if any.

It's a discussion I'm fine having, but it looks like even the IOMMU
maintainers are not on the same page here ;-p.

We're not saying this will work for everyone, but rather, this is a
default implementation that does nothing, and if you need to do
something, override it with your own. I guess if that's really
problematic, we can force the user to provide one and keep the NOP
implementation on Tyr's side.

Boris
