Sure, as a separate PR is fine.

There have already been high-profile departures from the Rust for Linux
project due to the open hostility of certain kernel maintainers. The
tension in the air is palpable, and so is the lowering morale.

I'm encouraging the people involved to stop playing nice and start
playing hardball in these cases, because playing nice does not work with
some people. Taking the high road only works with people who want to
cooperate and reach a solution that works for everyone. People who
openly do not want to cooperate nor reach any sort of reasonable
solution should be shunned and ignored, as is the case here.

My argument above may not be "technical" in the technology sense, but it
is quite specific and objective: Christoph has made it *very* clear that
he is not intending to reach any sort of workable solution. He has
decided that he doesn't want Rust in the Linux kernel and will do
whatever he can to stop it, which fundamentally clashes with the goals
of the R4L project in an irreconcilable way. He may have his own
"technical" reasoning for this, but this is irrelevant, because there is
no way to appeal to his technical concerns and the technical goals of
the R4L project simultaneously.

What he is doing is quite literally the dictionary definition of
"sabotage". Since his goal is to sabotage the R4L project, in its
fundamental goal, no amount of purely technical discussion will allow us
to reach a workable solution. Therefore, the only possible reaction is
social in nature: Ignore Christoph, and work around him.
