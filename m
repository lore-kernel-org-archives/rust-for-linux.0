Ok I think you are right w.r.t. it might be simpler to not have
significantly staged unwinding logic in the HALs. That said, IIUC, in
principle, it could unwind a bit better than the unload bundle. For
example, if we fail before we send the CoT message, then we don't need
to do anything to reset. If we fail after a CoT response, then we can
wait for GSP to halt and then try a falcon level reset if that fails. If
we fail sending the CoT message, then perhaps it needs a FLR to be sure
that things are properly reset - I think these are some options for
trying to ensure reset on GH100+.

I think we could centralise a lot of this reset logic, e.g. overall it
would be send guest unload, wait for halt, then start trying various
resets if GSP doesn't halt. This could be some HAL methods I suppose,
and Gsp::unload just deals with running the completely common Gsp guest
unload + calling the HAL bundle.

So that fits with keeping Gsp::unload out of HAL modules, but also
keeping the ScopeGuard run unload bundle in HAL boot() etc so we can
allow HALS to e.g. keep resources alive until GSP is definitely reset.
Then in a follow up we can harden the reset process to handle more
cases.

WDYT?
