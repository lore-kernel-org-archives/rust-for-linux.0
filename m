By kernel and mesa policy, while a drm/ kernel driver is not merged with
a stable UAPI, the mesa side cannot be merged/enabled either. That means
that every day the driver isn't upstream, our users suffer due to
various container technologies not shipping the driver in userspace
since they ship upstream mesa.

The process is *designed* to encourage upstreaming early and *punish*
downstream trees.

It's not just distros shipping, or even typical container technologies
like Flatpak (we have a workaround for that specific one). We'd need to
get stuff like Android/AOSP to ship the patched userspace driver so it
works in Waydroid, which some people want to use. It is an impossible task.

Never mind that distros aren't, in fact, inclined to ship out-of-tree
kernels. PREEMPT_RT was an exception due to its general usefulness, and
even then was not available everywhere, and had a reasonable excuse for
being out-of-tree so long due to its intrusiveness in core code. Rust
and the Rust drivers aren't even remotely as intrusive, they just stay
off to the side in their own directories. Nobody wants to ship
downstream kernels just for random hardware support.

Out of tree doesn't work. People, both in the kernel and out of the
kernel, want things in tree.
