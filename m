Yeah, that is what I mean, i.e. you have to more variables to make it
do what you want.

At that point, a user could also equally set up an alias or a quick
one liner script to call the real command with whatever setup they
need. That would be more flexible too with essentially the same
complexity on their side.

There is the `src` path there, no? e.g. I use upstream distro images
to test some builds.

Yeah, what I was trying to say is that, at that point, you can just
have an alias (or a one liner script etc.) for the real command.

The user still needs to know how to use Docker/Podman/... anyway, i.e.
I would see the benefit if somehow this was the only command they
would need or if this handled some extra logic.

Definitely, I am not saying containers are a bad idea (I use them
myself), i.e. I am only talking about what is the best way to provide
this (e.g. documentation, a script, this new file, directly in the
main `Makefile`...).

kernel.org images would be nice, indeed.

Yeah, docs would be nice regardless of the way of wrapping it.

The script may be more involved, i.e. similar to the KUnit one, but
then you also gain the ability to provide more functionality/logic.

Say, for instance, the ability to test with a set of container images
that you define in the config file, to run certain things with the
built kernel (possibly in another container), and so on and so forth.

Personally, for a new script, I would use a normal `--flags` like
interface, and leave the Make-like one if one wants to pass the actual
Make ones. I would also allow the user to define a default image too
in their config file too, and things like that.

In other words, the idea is that you can actually easily use it
without typing a lot, e.g.

    scripts/container b defconfig

(Possibly aliasing `scripts/container` itself to something shorter locally)

Or even more high-level operations like the "build with my set of
toolchain images", "build patch by patch this range of commits inside
the container", etc.

But I know this may be way out of scope :) After all, it gets into the
realm of essentially a lot of the custom tooling/scripts that
different subsystems build for themselves over time.

In fact, another possibility to think about is generalizing the
existing KUnit one to support containers.

You're welcome! I hope that helped at least.

Cc'ing David/Rae/Shuah as well for the KUnit bits.

Cheers,
Miguel
