If the driver calls vector().expect() on an index that is actually out of
bounds, because someone made a mistake, e.g. because min_vecs changed and p=
eople
forgot to update the code, then nothing went "catastrophically wrong" to a =
point
that we need to BUG() the whole kernel.

I do not disagree; those points are all valid, but I think it is a case by =
case
question.

For drivers and in an already fallible cold path, I don't see a lot of valu=
e in
compromising on robustness against human mistakes for those reasons.

Quite some drivers are poorly maintained and patches don't receive a lot of
review before they are thrown in; Rust has a chance to significantly compen=
sate
the downsides of a monolithic kernel by increasing the robustness of this
weakest part.

If we encourage drivers to use accessors that potentially end up in BUG() f=
or
cases where it doesn't provide significant value, we may also diminish the
potential for additional robustness.
