Exactly.  That's why we use classification e.g. lock class - DEPT also
makes use of the concept.

DEPT doesn't use a full map in each page but uses a minimum space for a
timestamp in each to track when each starts to wait so as to use the
recorded timestamp when the event occurs e.g. folio_unlock().

That's a good news for lockdep.  (And even for DEPT :)

Sounds great.

I understand what you are going to tell.

However, it's worth noting that lockdep tracks dependencies basically
based on **lock acqusition orders** in the system.  To make it track
even rwlock and general synchronization mechanism as well, lockdep has
no choice but to get more complicated.

Focusing on only the dependency checking, the most parts of lockdep are
for the tricky things, so the reusable parts are not that big.

That's what DEPT did and what brought external wgen introduced in DEPT.
I was considering the exactly same thing :)

Again, lockdep that tracks lock acquisition orders can't do that.

It doesn't matter whether it's implemented using bit or not.  folio lock
is quite special since it's allowed to be released other than the
acquisition context that makes lockdep impossible to track them.

That's awsome anyway :)

Roughly:

   1. Similar or less effort is needed for the new one - retrofitting
      lockdep is not easy and big changes are required since the
      reusable parts are not that big.

   2. Even though you didn't agree, retrofitting it would risk its
      stability.

I meant, at least dependency checking engine should be altered, but you
make sense.  Worth thinking it more.

One of locking maintainers who I met in an LPC told me that he agrees
with the direction of DEPT and supports DEPT, not officially tho.

What he and other people are concerning w.r.t DEPT the most is, false
positives, which is the most important issue for now.

At the same time, I think the most important thing is to make DEPT
useful in practice especially with folio locks involved.  Actually, I'm
planning to share DEPT's true reports periodically to LKML and work with
people who believe DEPT can make things better.

Any advices will be welcome.  Thanks for your opinions.
