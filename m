I mean, you expressed a concern about a fence being signaled before the har=
dware
has been torn down accordingly. I provided arguments why I don't see that t=
he
concern holds and then you mentioned that the warning "might benefit others=
".

To me this sounded as if you had concrete scenarios in mind, which doesn't =
seem
to be the case. If that's correct, and given that there was no reply to my
arguments, it seems we can just remove it.

Maybe to further explain my reasoning:

The concern was that it could happen that the DriverFence is dropped while =
the
hardware still utilizes the memory "protected" by the fence. As mentioned, =
to me
this is not a concern because of the programming model we have in Rust. Tak=
e
this analogous DMA memory example:

	struct Channel<'a> {
	    shared: dma::Coherent<'a, Data>,
	}
=09
	impl Drop for Channel<'_> {
	    fn drop(&mut self) {
	        self.stop_hardware();
	        shared.free();
	    }
	}

We could use the exact same argument to require people to explicitly call f=
ree()
on a dma::Coherent allocation as the underlying hardware (represented by th=
e
channel) could still use the dma::Coherent allocation if we "drop it
accidentally".

But as you can see, the ownership is already properly expressed by Rust, th=
e
Channel owns the dma::Coherent allocation, so the memory can just be freed =
in
Coherent::drop().

The same applies to DriverFence, the thing that takes ownership is the thin=
g
that operates the hardware.

I did arrive at the conclusion to discuss whether we can't just get rid of =
the
warning entirely in my first reply [1], which you refer to, already.
