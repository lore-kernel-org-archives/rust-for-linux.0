What should be broken here? As far as I know the signaling path works perfectly fine.

What we have problems with is the lifetime of things.

The fence spinlock is consistently used for protecting the fence signaling, in other words it always happens with the spinlock held, same for adding callbacks.

The only thing which happens without the spinlock held is the fast path checking of the signaled and enable_signaling bits and as far as I can see that is ok as well.

The problem here is not about the state of the fence, but if the callbacks are still executed or not. And that is not a good task for a lock, instead what is usually used for that is a barrier and that is exactly what RCU provides.

I don't think we should decide that inside the framework, this is up to the implementation of the dma_fence backend.

By taking the lock for the callbacks we just move the complexity of handling from the framework into the dma_fence_ops implementations, and that is something I would *really* like to avoid.

It is perfectly possible that you need to take whatever lock you want to cleanup things. E.g. spinlock for list removal, common lock with the interrupt handler etc....

That's also why I said that the whole approach with the signaling and enable_signaling callback returning a boolean is broken.

Instead what we should do is to forward the requests to the dma_fence implementation. And that dma_fence implementation calls dma_fence_signaled() as necessary.

Simple cleanup tasks, like just list_del() you need to take a spinlock for so.

In the interrupt handler.

Yes, but we clearly want to get away from that.

See the calling order in the interrupt signaling path is driver -> framework.

While in the is_signaled/enable_signaling/set_deadline path it is framework -> driver.

The dma_fence framework solved this issue by using a shared external driver provided lock, and that lock is then taken before calling into the backend operations. But we want to get away from that and use an inline lock in each dma_fence.

So the only two possibilities I can see is to either call the backend without holding locks or force the backend operations to use a lockless approach for their internal handling.

Yeah, but I'm desperately trying to avoid the complexity of using a lockless approach in the driver implementation.

Just take a look at amdgpu_fence.c and how complex the RCU handling there becomes because of this issue here.

Or the dma_fence_chain and dma_fence_array containers, same problem there as well.

And I still think that this is the simpler and especially more defensive approach.

The dma_fence framework should not leak it's internal lock anywhere externally and that includes calls into the backend operations.
