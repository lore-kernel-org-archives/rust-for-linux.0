Jaemyung,

thanks sharing.

You still use scsi everywhere in your implementation protocol/scsi.rs build=
s
READ_10/16, WRITE_10/16, SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE and UNMAP CDB, so "decouple UFS =
from
SCSI" really means "copy a small part of sd and the SCSI error handling int=
o a
UFS driver." while JEDEC defines the UFS application layer as SCSI, the SCS=
I
work doesn't go away, you just move somewhere else, and it has to be writte=
n
again.

The "friction" claim is weak. SCSI has already been changed to fit UFS. Two
examples: UFS now uses SCSI simple copy, group number in scsi write command=
.

I doubt how far this can go. do we really need to pay effort for a new RUST=
 UFS
driver, I am not very confident, unless SCSI is removed from the UFS spec a=
nd
JEDEC defines native UFS commands, or we talk to the device directly with U=
PIU.
please name the JEDEC feature that the SCSI midlayer really blocked, or tha=
t was
historial issue which has been fixed.


I would also like to see the heavy and hard parts, because they are the par=
ts
that decide if this design worrks:

1, error handling: abort, LU reset, retries with limits, sense decoding, th=
is is
the very hard part of UFS driver.

2, user-space tools interface: SG_IO and bsg (sg3_utils, ufs-utils, FFU wit=
h
WRITE BUFFER), and the UFS sysfs tree..


Did any AI tool help write this code? If so, please add the Assisted-by: ta=
g.
