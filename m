> assumption that unloading in success is the same as unwinding in error.

I don't think `hal.boot()` can unwind its state properly - or I should
say, I don't think it can unwind it better than just running its unload
bundle itself.

There is little point calling `Gsp::unload` from a HAL failure as it
just queues an `UnloadGuestDriver` message (that the GSP wouldn't be in
condition to process) before running the unload bundle. So here we can
simply skip the guaranteed message timeout and run the unload bundle (or
the relevant part) directly. But even doing so doesn't guarantee that we
can recover.

For TU102, the unload bundle runs two firmwares to reset the GSP falcon
to its original state and to remove the WPR2 region. I don't think we
can/should run them selectively, as they don't undo work in the same
order as the boot sequence - or even from the same microcontroller! For
instance, FWSEC-FRTS (GSP falcon) sets up the WPR2 region, but it is
tore down by Booter Unload (SEC2 falcon). So the best we can do if
something fails on the boot path is run the whole unload bundle and hope
that we can recover.

For GH100, the unload bundle just waits for the GSP falcon to get out of
RISC-V mode, as a consequence of the `UnloadingGuestDriver` GSP command
sent by `Gsp::unload`. The problem is, that in case of failure that
command cannot even be sent as the GSP is not up! :) So the unload
bundle will either succeed immediately (if we failed early) or timeout
(if the GSP is already in RISC-V mode and stuck somewhere else). It's
actually probably better to not even try to run it in this case, and
just wait for the GSP lockdown release to try and address the DMA buffer
lifetime you raised.

Which supports your case that the HALs should be be responsible for
their own unwinding - only not by running `Gsp::unload` IMHO.

In any case, there doesn't seem to be a recovery path that we can
execute reliably in case of GSP boot failure. So making the HALs
responsible for recovering does indeed sound like the safest solution
(with TU102 trying to run the unload bundle, and GH100 doing... I'm not
sure what :)) and should address the issues you raised - but please let
me know if I missed something.
