You are correct in that device_del() has to be called only once, but the
idea of "thread safe" really isn't a thing in the kernel because we have
processes entering/exiting the code from all different places so things
better be "thread safe" almost everywhere, what matters to us as you
know is "context" due to sleep/locking issues.

So how about this wording instead:
	device_del() must be called from process context, not interrupt
	context, and also provides no protection against multiple calls
	for the same device.  It MUST be up to the caller to ensure that
	this function can only be called once for a given device.

Sure, but I think we are going to start getting "thread" confusion over
time here, is this something we want to start thinking about or am I
just running into it for the first time here?  I know it's a userspace
thing but not normally thought of in the kernel subsystems I'm familiar
with.
