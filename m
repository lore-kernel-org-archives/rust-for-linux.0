You are probably seeing this behavior within the last release or so
because of

  2625480a1bf7 ("hardening: Default randstruct off with rust for better allmodconfig support")

which allows Rust to be enabled with all{mod,yes}config to make -next
testing easier.

As for that particular error, is it a -next regression?

Note: The following is my understanding, Miguel or other Rust folks
might correct me.

You are noticing the face that certain Rust crates like kernel are built
in the prepare target, which will run for pretty much every build; it
has been this way since Rust has been merged, you are just noticing it
now because Rust is enabled in your configuration. I believe this was
done to ensure the kernel crate is built and available before drivers
were built via recursive make since they consume it. However, as you
have noticed, this implementation bogs down the build and the same
problem exists for Rust drivers that depend on other Rust abstractions
and such.

Miguel and I chatted about this at Plumbers and we absolutely want to
get it resolved but I am just not sure how quickly that will happen. In
the meantime, you could just use KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG to disable
CONFIG_RUST during configuration time so you can still use a single
command:

  make ... KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG=<(echo CONFIG_RUST=n) allyesconfig -- ...
