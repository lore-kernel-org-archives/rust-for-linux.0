No, you miss the point. Look at the bug. It exists because nouveau
thinks it can drop a reference now because the fence is signaled.

I grant the point, though, that this is actually a refcounting issue.
The path that is signaling does not have its own extra reference.

You mean the lockless checking of a bit that is set under lock-
protection works as intended?

That's not what I mean. There are two things here:

a) signaled-bit is read without lock-protection
b) signaled-bit is set before callbacks execute

fixing a) makes b) irrelevant.

But that's not even my point in this mail.


I'm still interested btw in who is busy-polling on a fence, waiting
until the signaled-bit gets true (that would be the "performance"
argument).

If you want to know when a fence changes from unsignaled to signaled,
use this function:

dma_fence_add_callback()

problem solved.

Again, ops->signaled() merely has to read an atomic64_t and return a
bool. Driver locks are not required here.

My entire point is that the driver does not need any driver-lock
conflicting with the fence-lock-order at all.

I tried to point this out several times, but you keep iterating back to
"this is what nouveau does".

That nouveau does it does not proof that it's necessary. It just proofs
that nouveau does it.

Good!

So we agree that the dma_fence backend should give clear guidance about
what a driver must, must not and should do in its backend_ops
implementations.

Right?

Because so far the conversation sounded to me like "the driver must be
able to do whatever it wants and therefore needs to be able to grab
whatever locks".

Calling Nouveau a "perfect example" is like calling Ronald McDonald a
role model in dietary choices.

Nova is being written right now, for reasons.

is_signaled() never conflicts with any lock, see my list above.

I think at this point you and I should really first get in sync
regarding what the backend_ops are supposed to do, because we seem to
turn in circles a bit in our discussion.

And the only ops that seems to be controversial and that informs the
nouveau argument is ops->enable_signaling()

What should enable_signaling() do, in your mind? What should we tell
the driver to do in there?

And why does nouveau even implement it, when its interrupt handler will
ultimately signal the fence anyways. Since, as usual, nothing is
documented, and one enable_signaling function carries literally the
name "no_signaling", I don't give it the benefit of the doubt and just
assume that this is broken, bad design.


My impression is that ops->enable_signaling() and having an interrupt
handler signaling fences is mutually exclusive design-wise.
