Things I have now learned about a DEFLATE stream (RFC 1951):

- The Huffman tables are per-block, so emitting multiple tables in a
  single stream is already required. (I only just knew about ZIP indexes
  being singular, but I was confused: that's about the container not
  the compression.)
- Each pigz thread keeps a 32K back-reference window for its tables so
  it isn't starting a fresh table each block.

Very cool! The first makes parallelism possible at all, and the second
makes it work well: it's not just restarting the compression at every
block boundary.

Yeah, good points. What you have is quite simple.

There are 2 things I'm thinking about:

a)
My main concern is the lack of respecting the -j make argument. In my
mind, this is a blocker, because it means a build will now _always_ spin
up max CPUs (not what -j has limited it to), and for CIs, shared compute
systems, or whatever, this violates the requested parallelism level. For
example, if I'm doing a long-running Coccinelle replacement in one tree
(which uses half the CPUs), any builds I launch I'm asking for the other
half of my CPUs to be used so they don't thrash my cache.

This is the kind of "why are all the CPUs spinning up?" question I
helped track down with commit 51e46c7a4007 ("docs, parallelism: Rearrange
how jobserver reservations are made") forever ago.

The next is kind of a special-case version of the above concern:

b)
There's nothing that ties KGZIP to only being used for final images
(and in fact, it also does modules, as you show), and it's defined as
part of "cmd_gzip", so it could be used at any moment in the build:

$ git grep call.*,gzip | wc -l
23

And it does have one use outside of the (presumed) final image build in
the per-arch /boot/ rules besides modules, for config_data:

$ git grep call.*,gzip | grep -v /boot/
Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.rst:            $(call if_changed,gzip)
kernel/Makefile:        $(call if_changed,gzip)
scripts/Makefile.modinst:       $(call cmd,gzip)

So I'm nervous about a general-purpose tool and Kbuild infrastructure
suddenly going max parallel in the middle of a build some day when
another gzip use is added.

Does that impact wall-clock results meaningfully? I'd really like to
avoid losing correctness in favor of speed here, especially when we
already have a solution at hand for exactly this problem.

It is possible that it is so fast no one will notice, but I really worry
that there are going to be many sysadmins driven to figuring out why
their build systems suddenly spike the CPU use, and then waste their
time tracking it down and reporting it to us, but we can solve it today.

Fair enough, though I do worry that this is vaguely "undiscoverable" in
the sense that if you happen to have pigz installed, suddenly it gets
used. (We have other such "try to use this other tool first" logic,
really; we have Kconfig stuff for detecting all sorts of capabilities,
but I couldn't find examples like this one. Maybe I missed it.)

So the "make it the default" suggestion is more about having better
determinism in the build requirements. Perhaps add pigz to changes.rst
and/or ver_linux so it is seen/recorded somewhere?
