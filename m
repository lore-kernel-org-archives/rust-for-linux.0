As an assumption of use for the Rust API, like I say it's fine - it's 
still not really "unsafe" if a caller did try an overlapping mapping; 
the call will still fail gracefully and accurately, it's just it will 
also fire a WARN_ON() since ARM_64_LPAE_S1 without 
IO_PGTABLE_QUIRK_NO_WARN considers this indicative of a usage error or 
race in the caller.

If we do end up wanting to support more opportunistic and/or 
userspace-controlled mappings by Rust drivers in future then we can 
relax this expectation as appropriate.

Aha, thanks for clarifying - indeed this is not the common "value or 
error" case, it is two (almost) orthogonal return values. However if 
we're not permitting callers to try to do anything clever with -EEXIST 
then it might make sense to just embed the inevitable cleanup-on-failure 
boilerplate here anyway (even if we still leave retry-on-partial-success 
to the caller).

Note that it does appear to be the case that io-pgtable-arm in its 
current state won't actually do this, since it happens to handle all its 
error return cases before any leaf PTEs are touched and "mapped" is 
updated, but the abstraction layer shouldn't assume that in general 
since other implementations like io-pgtable-arm-v7s definitely *can* 
fail with a partial mapping.

Yes, that's a nice way to put it.

Thanks,
Robin.
