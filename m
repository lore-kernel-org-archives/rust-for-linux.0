See my response to Greg. The SCSI specific code in this driver is very

I am sure the UFS experts will be able to answer this better than me.

I agree. However, we decided to get the discussion going with a smaller
feature set. We can build an efficient feature complete driver, but we
would really like to talk to the community about it first.

On the account of this not being a scsi driver, some changes would have
to be made. But we should be able support
/sys/bus/platform/drivers/ufshcd/* just fine.

We use AI for code review and spell checking, so I guess the tag is warrant=
