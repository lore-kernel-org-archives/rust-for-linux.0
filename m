I think there never was a "rather than". The point was that if userspace ha=

conditionals based on the architecture it shouldn't have to figure it out b=

on the chipid, as this has been done by the kernel already.

I still don't see how that value will ever be meaningful, there is no such =
thing
as "all GPUs of a certain implementation regardless of architecture" have
something in common, is it?

But since you say "currently at least", are there any plans to give this va=
lue
some meaning beyond being a unique counter for chips within a certain
architecture?

If so, I think that'd be a horrible way to encode some chip commonality.

Because userspace otherwise has to figure out the architecture itself based=
 on
the chipid, while the kernel already did derive this information.

There's many ways userspace could do this, and I don't want to incentivise =
any
of them.

For instance, you previously showed how userspace derives the SM value from=
 the
chipid with sm_for_chipset() in mesa with its own lookup table.

Then in NAK (src/nouveau/compiler/nak/ir.rs), there's this code.

	fn is_turing(&self) -> bool {
	    self.sm() >=3D 73 && self.sm() < 80
	}
=09
	fn is_ampere(&self) -> bool {
	    self.sm() >=3D 80 && self.sm() < 89
	}
=09
	fn is_ada(&self) -> bool {
	    self.sm() =3D=3D 89
	}
=09
	#[allow(dead_code)]
	fn is_hopper(&self) -> bool {
	    self.sm() >=3D 90 && self.sm() < 100
	}
=09
	fn is_blackwell_a(&self) -> bool {
	    self.sm() >=3D 100 && self.sm() < 110
	}
=09
	fn is_blackwell_b(&self) -> bool {
	    self.sm() >=3D 120 && self.sm() < 130
	}
=09
	fn is_blackwell(&self) -> bool {
	    self.is_blackwell_a() || self.is_blackwell_b()
	}

That's two unnecessary indirections for something the kernel already has
available.

Yeah, although if SM is correctly reported by the GSP, I'd rather have it
exported in an info structure than have userspace create its own lookup tab=
le.
