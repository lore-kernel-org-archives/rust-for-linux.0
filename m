This was my first thought as well.

But I found it a bit odd that users would still have to define T, then I th=
ought
we could have a type alias, e.g.

	type CoherentHandle =3D Coherent<[u8], NoMapping>;

In this case the constructor would be CoherentHandle::zeroed_slice(), which=
 I
find a bit odd as well.

Alternatively, we could have a const SIZE generic on CoherentHandle wrappin=
g
Coherent<[u8; SIZE], NoMapping>.

Then we'd get CoherentHandle::<SIZE>::zeroed() (which I find much better), =
but
we would still have Coherent<T, NoMapping> publically available, which I st=
ill
find a bit odd.

And then I thought, it's probably not worth the additional complexity and a
separate CoherentHandle type is probably good enough.

This is a reason for having Coherent<T, NoMapping>, but I'm not sure it is =
an
improvement in the first place.

If the memory is not mapped on the CPU side it is probably just an opaque
buffer. And I'm not sure there is a huge advantage in defining a structure
representing any relevant offsets and then do an I/O projection compared to=
 just
having constants or an enum defining those offsets.

I also think there's not a huge difference in terms of robustness. In the f=
ormer
case, if you mess up the offsets, the buffer size will be wrong (unless mul=
tiple
offsets are wrong and compensate each other) and the device will not proper=
ly
work on runtime.

In the latter case, you either also pass a wrong offset to the device, or y=
ou
get a compile-time error if the offset is out of bounds (which is probably =
even
better).

Also, consider the case where the offset into the opaque buffer is dynamic,=
 then
a type and I/O projections won't help either.
