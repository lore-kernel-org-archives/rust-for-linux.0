Strictly speaking, this isn't true. Forgefed federation was tested very ear=
ly=20
on with Codeberg's Gitea fork (before it was called Forgejo) and Pagure wit=
h=20
its Forgefed extension[1]. The initial design and development was across th=
ree=20
forge systems (Vervis, Forgejo, and Pagure).

Even before that, Pagure has data portability built into its design in a wa=
y=20
no other forge has today: all project metadata is stored as JSON data check=
ed=20
into specialized Git repos. That means it's trivial to mirror and archive=20
projects to have redundant instances or failover instances to support whate=
ver=20
reliability and high availability guarantees you'd like.

And insofar as cross system contributions, Pagure supports making pull=20
requests that pull from arbitrary Git servers (as long as the Pagure instan=
ce=20
can connect to it) with its remote pull request feature. That has been a co=
re=20
feature for nearly the entire time it has existed.

It's not that it wasn't possible, it's just nobody cares. In the 11 years=20
since Pagure was created, literally no other forge has even intimated that=
=20
they want even *some* of the concepts Pagure has. Extensibility and=20
portability are simply not important concepts to anyone anymore.

If it was, maybe more people would have been excited about Pagure, I'd have=
=20
more contributors to that project, and there'd be more deployments out ther=
e=20
showing it off.

It is what it is, I guess. =E2=98=B9=EF=B8=8F

That's really a self-inflicted choice. Adoption is always a catch-22. If yo=
u=20
really wanted federated forge development and have some aspect of=20
decentralized development, you always can even with forges or other tools.=
=20
It's just not something being considered or explored in the Linux kernel=20
community, despite how much some folks dislike the email-based workflow.

Honestly, this is probably not possible. If a subsystem moves to a forge=20
workflow, it pretty much means tree-wide changes need to work partially tha=
t=20
way too.
