Ack. And the other rust changes help maximise the parallelisation
that exists :)

Yup that stalling is the key issue.

I mean KRUSTFLAGS=-Zthreads=8 gives you a way to achieve that, I'll stick
that into my scripts locally for now too I think as I've found it to be
completely stable at least on my machine (TM).

But definitely a TODO to pin for you guys once this is stabilised - it
makes a big difference so when a. stabilised and b. kernel required minimum
version has the stabilised feature -> easy to switch on :)

I agree, best to drop this in general, done for v3 already. I've updated
the cover letter to say that KRUSTFLAGS=-Zthreads=8 is what was done with
the build.

I don't think it's too egregious either way tbh, but in any case dropping
this for now is the way to go.
