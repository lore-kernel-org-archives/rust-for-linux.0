On an abstract level a USB interface is a device that is operated by some
driver, which is why from a driver core topology point of view, a struct
usb_interface *is* a struct device. And there is no layering violation in
shortening:

	intf.device().bulk_send();

to

	intf.bulk_send();

Now, I get that this might read a bit odd from a pure USB topology perspect=
ive,
but what this shortcut gives you is that it allows you to not create types =
with
incorrect type states intermediately.

If USB folks really want the API to have an indirection, so it matches the =
USB
topology reading a bit better, just create an abstract a new type, e.g.:

	struct IoDevice<'a> {
	    intf: &'a usb::Interface<Bound>,
	}

which only provides the corresponding I/O methods, but does not give you ac=
cess
to a "real" usb::Device<Bound>. This way you can still write:

	intf.device().bulk_send();

if that's preferrable.

Interestingly, looking at your series, it already does something like this,=
 but
it's called IoWindow and oddly reimplements the lifecycle constraints the R=
ust
driver core infrastructure already provides.

Well, Alan also said this:

"At first I thought that we ought to have such a guarantee.  But in fact we
don't, because the user can at any time write to a USB device's
bConfigurationValue sysfs attribute even if the device isn't bound to a dri=
ver.
This can create interfaces which may then be bound to drivers."

This was a reply to me asking:

"So, what you're saying is that, in the generic case, there is a guarantee =
that
if a usb_interface is bound to a usb_driver, then the usb_interface's paren=
t
usb_device is also bound to a usb_device_driver."
