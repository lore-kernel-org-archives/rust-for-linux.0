Yeah that's fair enough and Arnd makes a good point about O(n^2) too.

Hmm yeah. Splitting this off seems sensible then. As you suggest in your
other reply which I shall reply to (it seems the right way forward tbh!).

No (LLM says ~.01s per build for jobserve-exec, once) so actually that big
of a deal.

Yeah that's a fair point also.

Yup that's a thing but I think this is a very worthwhile case!

Ack!
