The "everything needs to be thread safe" mantra makes a lot of sense for
C, since there it will blow up in your face very quickly if you make a
mistake (and crucially, I can imagine a lot of nasty bugs that only
show themselves once another change is made years later). But with Rust,
we can let the compiler enforce the rules and thus allow more efficient
constructs in places where we know that the object only stays on one
"thread".
Also, there are several concepts in C that are associated with a type in
Rust that are inherently thread-unsafe. For example RCU: you're not
allowed to take the RCU lock and then context-switch to another "thread"
(or whatever the right term is) and unlock RCU there. In Rust, we would
model that with a guard object that you're not allowed to send to
another thread. (if you tried to do it, you would get a compiler error)
The same is true for locking a mutex (I haven't been in the loop w.r.t.
the C lock guards, AFAIK they exist and would have the same problem, so
after locking, you're not allowed to move it to another thread (if that
is even possible with how they are implemented)) and having a pointer to
an object that one doesn't own a reference count to (I imagine that that
rarely happens, but in Rust you're allowed to do that as long as there
is some synchronization that guarantees that another thread still holds
a refcount).

This has come up in several past discussions, including the confusion
around the terminology. I'll take this as an opportunity to clear things
up and explain the Rust terminology in a bit more detail. If you're
already up to speed, others will surely benefit from this.

I also have some confusion about what your terms are and what they mean,
so it would be great if you either have a pointer or a quick overview +
explanation (or someone else of course).

In the following I will continue to use "thread", because that's what I
am used to. "Thread" to me means a different execution context in the
abstract machine: it has a function call stack, local variables and
executes code instructions one after the other. Any execution that does
not infinitely starve a thread and upholds synchronization primitives is
a valid one for the abstract machine. So in particular when not using
synchronization between threads, the program can behave
non-deterministically.

So we are doing all of this business solely for the purpose of keeping
our programs deterministic. (which is a great property :)



In Rust terms, we have two traits `Send` and `Sync` that -- at least in
user space -- govern whether an object can be sent (`Send`) or shared
(`Sync`) between threads. "Shared" in this context just means that
you're allowed to send shared references to other threads. So `T: Sync`
is just a short way of saying `&T: Send`. Sending a value to another
thread means giving up ownership of it and moving it to that other
thread [^a] (most of the time in the form of moving a pointer to the
value there). When talking about thread-safety, one can mean one or the
other, or both (which is a bit annoying and the reason for my preference
for saying "this type is not `Send`" instead of saying "it's not thread
safe").

This "special" meaning of these traits is not really special at all.
They are just normal traits [^b] and their meaning comes from their
usage as bounds for generics. For example, in std when spawning a new
thread, one can only give it ownership of data that implements `Send`
[1]. This also holds for any other process of moving data between
threads such as channels or shareable smart pointers.
Importantly, in the kernel, we can shape our own meaning of `Send` and
`Sync` (at least to a degree, as there are some constraints that core
gives us), since it only depends on how the bounds of them are used. We
even could introduce new traits that have different meaning such as "can
be shared with this other context" while `Send` still means "can be
shared with any other context". But such an addition should be done very
carefully, as it's a huge pain if we later find out we would like to
change it, as it infects everything.



Now to give some examples and further explain the meaning of `Send` and
`Sync` in user-space. I will start off with a possibly surprising fact:
there are types that are `Sync` but `!Send` and vice versa. For the
first case, there is the `MutexGuard` [2] from std. But also the `Guard`
[3] type from the kernel crate. This is because, unlocking a user-space
mutex and a kernel lock type respectively is not possible from a
different thread than where it was locked. However, accessing the data
behind such a lock in a shared manner *is* possible (of course only if
that other thread knows that the first one still holds the lock and
isn't writing to the data), thus it still is `Sync`.
For the flipped case (`Send` but `!Sync`) there are -- to Rust
programmers well-known -- cell types, but they have little to no
counterpart in C, so I present a different example: the `Receiver` [4]
of the multiple-producer-single-consumer channel of std. Since there is
only supposed to be one receiver thread, the receiver type cannot be
cloned and it must not be shared, hence it implements `!Sync`. But
you're still allowed to move the ownership of receiving into another
thread and thus that type is `Send`.

Another examples is `Rc<T>` [5], a non-atomically reference counted
smart pointer. It implements neither `Send` nor `Sync`. It must not be
`Send`, because if it were, then the non-atomicity of the reference
count would be a problem. It also must not be `Sync`, since one
increment the refcount using a shared reference and that is again a
problem. So if one knows that a value is only used by one thread, then
`Rc<T>` is a more performant option over `Arc<T>` (the atomic refcounted
smart pointer).



Now to discuss what `Send` and `Sync` (could) mean in the kernel. One
current usage that I already mentioned is that they prevent unlocking a
mutex on a different thread than where it was locked. I do not know what
"thread" would be in this case other than the abstract definition I gave
above. But I heard that interrupts might behave similarly to user-space
threads in that you're not allowed to release/lock a lock on one that
was/is locked/released in normal execution context on the same CPU (no
idea if this is actually true, I might be misremembering here).
Another location where we're also using `Send` already is the workqueue.
If you take a look at the `enqueue` [6] function, then you will notice
the `Send` type bound in the function signature. It ensures that
whatever values sent to the code executed in the workqueue have to be
`Send`.
Timers will be another example: if you look at the upcoming hrtimer
abstractions by Andreas [7], then you can find a `Sync` bound in the
`HrTimerPointer` trait. So timers will only have shared access to values
that can be shared between threads.

The safest approach (and IIRC the one that we're currently pursuing) to
the meaning of `Send` and `Sync` is to just be very strict about what is
considered the same thread. That also allows us to always use `Send` and
`Sync` in cases where we're unsure if a value should be allowed to be
shared with/moved into another context. This is not going to result in
any memory issues, as we are essentially forbidding everything except
the most obvious things that are OK, but it might lead to missing
functionality/pain when implementing something.
I don't believe that there will be many thread definition where we
decide that they don't constitute a different "thread" in the sense of
`Send`/`Sync`, but that's just my intuition. Maybe I am wrong and there
is something that could technically be considered a different thread,
but it doesn't make sense to e.g. forbid moving a mutex there, since
it's fine.

Lastly, I want to try to bikeshed the name "thread", as clearly, we're
missing a proper term here. I have seen some people use CPU, execution
context and others that I forgot, but I never heard one that was as
satisfactory as I find "thread". At least that's my user-space
perspective, since to you "thread" could mean kernel-thread or
user-space-thread (and maybe more?). I don't like CPU, since interrupts
might happen on the same CPU, but would have to be considered a
different thread. And execution context also seems wrong, since I
associate that with the state of preemption, so atomic context.
Maybe "abstract thread" fits the concept best, but I don't like the fact
that it still contains the word thread.

[^a]: Note that references (i.e. `&T`) implement `Copy`, so they are
      automatically cloned and thus sending one to another thread
      doesn't entail giving up on it yourself.

[^b]: People knowledgable in Rust might pause here, since they still are
      special in a different sense, as they are auto traits. But that
      has nothing to do with their meaning, so one can just disregard
      that specialty.
