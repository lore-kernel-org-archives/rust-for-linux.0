Subject: [RFC PATCH v2 15/18] rust: drm: support hardware cursor planes with sleepable event delivery

A driver that forwards a hardware cursor plane's contents to userspace (e.g.
DisplayLink's evdi, whose daemon composites the cursor itself) needs to hand the
client a GEM handle for the cursor bitmap on each update. drm_gem_handle_create()
may sleep, so the connected file must be reachable from sleepable context -- but
drm::event::EventChannel stored the receiver under the device event_lock (a
spinlock).

Rework EventChannel to guard the receiver with a Mutex instead: send() holds it
across the event_lock-protected reserve+queue (so delivery still cannot race a
close), and a new with_receiver() runs a closure with the connected File while
holding the mutex, allowing a sleepable GEM-handle creation without the file
closing underneath it (notify_close() takes the same mutex). new() now takes a
lock class so the class lives in the driver module. connect/disconnect/
notify_close/is_connected no longer need the device.

Add the accessors such a cursor consumer needs:
  - plane state crtc_x()/crtc_y() (cursor position) and hotspot_x()/hotspot_y();
  - Framebuffer::format() (FourCC) and Framebuffer::create_handle() (a GEM handle
    for plane-0 in a given file).
