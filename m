It definitely is your responsibility to test your tree. This is basic stuff=
.

And I am not sure what you are trying to imply here with your words in
your reply, but I personally find your message and its tone borderline
unacceptable. I was actually trying to help you, so it is doubly
annoying to get such a reply, to be honest.

I will reply to a few things below to keep the record straight now
that LPC is over and I had the chance to talk about this to a few
people.

They are not comments: they are _documentation_, which is different,
not just conceptually, but also technically. From that idea, the rest
follows quite easily.

They are also not tests in the sense of "we write tests like this" --
they are primarily *examples*,  which are a fundamental part of the
documentation. They are not supposed to replace tests.

And it is important to understand that those examples would be there
*anyway* whether we compiled them or not. The fact that we actually
can not just build but runtime test them within KUnit is a very good
thing, because it ensures that the examples that developers wrote are
actually true *and remain true* even across refactoring/time.

That is, the examples will always reflect the reality of the API, the
asserts will always represent the true return values of the API, there
will be no typos of all kinds when typing the examples, and so on and
so forth.

Regardless of all that, other (non-Rust) maintainers do want to have doctes=
ts.

So, no, doctests are staying, and we are writing more of them, not
less. In fact, new APIs should come with examples unless there is a
good reason not to.

> The other problem is that Miguel replied in great details about how
> well rust process is designed,

The point was not to tell you about how "well designed" anything is
"in great detail", and I am not sure if you are sarcastically saying
this.

I simply gave you a link to our docs and suggested you could have a
similar field in the `MAINTAINERS` file, because in my experience
(which you can easily check in the mailing list) people actually do
write and test doctests.

As I said, I was just trying to help.

> and even attached an external link,
> but didn't answer my question: how to enable rustdoc by default?

I *did* answer your question, and pretty directly:

  1) I explained it was not a `rustdoc` target issue.

  2) I explained the Kconfig should not be enabled by default.

Now, it is clear that you are still quite confused about what failed
and that you didn't take the time to read into the link I provided, or
the docs, or the Kconfig option I mentioned.

So from your point of view, since you thought this was a different
topic, I guess you could have thought "Miguel is talking to me about
unrelated things". That is fine, but you can always say it politely,
and I would have tried to clear the confusion again.

It does (both) and I quote:

    When submitting changes to tests, including #[test]s, Kselftests
and examples inside Rust code documentation (i.e. "doctests", which
are transformed into KUnit tests), please test them.

You are just confusing the issue. This is about *testing*, not about
`rustdoc`, as I already explained in my previous message, so you read
the wrong bullet point.

It even clarifies what doctests are and even links to the "Testing" in
the kernel tree which is a page dedicated to explain this.

Even if you missed that, I even explicitly told you in my previous
message the Kconfig option you had to enable.

Even if the docs were wrong or may be improved, your message is just
not a productive way to engage.

Yes, it does very explicitly explain the mandatory steps. No, they are
not comments. No, this is not about the `rustdoc` target. See above
for the quotes.

> No, it does not. So, I wasted an hour just to find nothing. But there

Yes, it does. And you didn't have to "find" anything. I *explicitly
told you* the Kconfig you needed in my previous message.

What do you mean? Where do you want to go with this? Please speak
clearly here -- veiled comments aren't useful nor polite.

Submitters are definitely supposed to test their code, just like for
any other code. And as a maintainer you are the one that decides what
is "good enough" etc.

But everyone misses things from time to time, sometimes authors are
newcomers, sometimes they may not have their full testing setup
nearby, etc., so you as a maintainer still need to test it anyway.

That is the point -- both submitters and maintainers are supposed to
work in tandem and double-check the other side, since anyone can miss
things.

To me, it sounds like just because you don't like doctests, you are
going to ask *everyone else* to do the testing for you, which
personally doesn't sound acceptable to me, to be honest.

I also find it a bit amusing, because you told me "Maintainers are not
handy testers at your convenience": To me, it sounds like *you* are
the one asking others to test your branch for you.

No. You don't get to blame others here. I am always happy to "review
the process" to improve it, but this issue has nothing to do with
that.

The process is quite clear, has been documented/followed/discussed for
a long time, and other subsystems and maintainers take advantage of
the feature and use it extensively.

It is obviously fine to not know about something (nobody can read
everything), but that doesn't mean you get to pass the buck and to
change how it all works just because you don't like doctests unless
you convince everyone using the feature that they shouldn't use it
anymore.

And it seems you also ignored from my message why the doctests are not
built in every config (which is very much done on purpose), and
instead keep pushing for it, which is not useful and is not going to
go anywhere.

Cheers,
Miguel
