Subject: [PATCH v2 2/2] rust: std_vendor: add `likely()`, `unlikely()` and `cold_path()`

`feature(cold_path)` is becoming stable [1] in the upcoming Rust 1.95.0
(expected 2026-04-16).

`cold_path()` can be used directly, but it also allows us to provide
`likely()` and `unlikely()`, based on `cold_path()`, similar to the C
side ones.

For instance, given:

    fn f1(a: i32) -> i32 {
        if a < 0 {
            return 123;
        }

        42
    }

    fn f2(a: i32) -> i32 {
        if likely(a < 0) {
            return 124;
        }

        42
    }

    fn f3(a: i32) -> i32 {
        if unlikely(a < 0) {
            return 125;
        }

        42
    }

LLVM emits the same code it would for similar C functions:

    f1:
            test   %edi,%edi
            mov    $0x7b,%ecx
            mov    $0x2a,%eax
            cmovs  %ecx,%eax
            ret

    f2:
            mov    $0x7c,%eax
            test   %edi,%edi
        /-- jns    <f2+0xa>
        |   ret
        \-> mov    $0x2a,%eax
            ret

    f3:
            test   %edi,%edi
        /-- js     <f3+0xa>
        |   mov    $0x2a,%eax
        |   ret
        \-> mov    $0x7d,%eax
            ret

The feature itself, `feature(cold_path)`, was added in Rust 1.86.0 [2].

Previously, a PR in Rust 1.84.0 [3] fixed a number of issues with the
`likely()` and `unlikely()` intrinsics (by implementing them on top of
the new `cold_path()` intrinsic). So we could use that, in principle,
for Rust 1.85.0. However, it is just a single version, and it is simpler
to avoid intrinsics. Instead, approximate it with `#[cold]` [4].

Thus add support for `cold_path()` by applying several approaches:

  - For Rust >= 1.86.0, `use` directly `core`'s `cold_path()`.

  - For Rust 1.85, provide a `#[cold]` no-op, and vendor `core`s
    documentation.

And, for all versions, simply provide `likely()` and `unlikely()` based
on `cold_path()`, by vendoring `core`'s unstable ones (the one from
`intrinsics`, not the `hint` wrapper, to save a layer).

In the future, if `likely()` and `unlikely()` become stable [5], we may
want to use them directly as well.

Now, in the C side, the `likely()` and `unlikely()` macros come
from `compiler.h`, which means it is pretty much available everywhere
directly. Thus just add these to the prelude (instead of e.g. re-exporting
them in the root or in a new `hint` module).

This will also mean less churn when we can remove the `cold_path()`
version from `std_vendor` (and potentially the other two too).

I tested that Rust 1.93.0 generate the code above and, in a previous
version of the patch, that Rust 1.83.0 and 1.78.0 do not, as expected.

v1: https://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/20260208224659.18406-3-ojeda@kernel.org/
v2:
  - Drop the intrinsics and use `#[cold]` for Rust 1.85.0.

  - Sorted after `feature(file_with_nul)` since now we know which was
    the stable version when it happened (Rust 1.92.0).

  - Rebased and reworded accordingly.
