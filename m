Hi Zhi,

Thank you, Zhi, for the detailed explanation. The shift toward a 
stricter OO-style abstraction with `Io` trait integration and 
`register!` macros makes a lot of sense and probably you could fold my 
`CapabilityId` definitions and lookup logic into your series at your 
will and consequently, I could withdraw my patch set to avoid further 
duplication.

I look forward to discussing how to best align our efforts. I'm also 
interested in taking on additional tasks, such as the iterator 
implementation, once the underlying `Io` trait refactor settles.

Best regards,
Zijing
