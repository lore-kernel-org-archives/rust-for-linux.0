As mentioned, I don't think the safety requirement has to be before using o=
ther
DMA APIs, but just requiring to not do it concurrently. Not doing it would =
be a
semantic bug, but it shouldn't have any safety implications.

Just to clarify, I mentioned this to be something we could do in addition t=
o (1)
for drivers where those values are statically known.

Yeah, we had this discussion in the past with similar ideas; it is the kind=
 of
complication that we concluded not to be worth it and that I mentioned in m=
y
initial reply.

The only safety relevant issue should really be the data race of the primit=
ives
values being set, which is more on the theoretical side of things.

I think that doesn't work, there are drivers that need to perform MMIO befo=
re
knowing e.g. the DMA mask, i.e. we can't have Pin<&'bound mut Device<Core<'=
_>>>
at the same time as e.g. pci::Bar<'_>, which borrows a &Device<Bound>.
