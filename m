Okay, it starts to click. So ioctls get passed the drm::Registration,
which has both a device and some driver specific data (I guess it's
even hidden behind the File abstraction). During early probe, we'd still
be able to pass an Unregistered variant of the device, and then our
current TyrDrmDeviceData would be attached to the Registration object
when Registration::new_foreign_owned() is called.

This probably imply changing the places where we currently access our
TyrDrmDeviceData through the drm::Device, but hopefully there's not
many of those cases.

Yep, that we can solve.

Yep, makes sense.

No worries, that's the usual back-and-forth happening during reviews,
and it's all fine.

Got it.
