Of course :)

Join the IRC channel - irc.oftc.net#bcache, we've got quite a few people
acquainted with Rust there.

The main thing that needs to be sorted out is that we require a patched
version of bindgen (since rustc can't yet handle types that are both
packed and aligned); we need to talk to the rust-for-linux people about
whether they'll be ok with switching the kernel to the patched bindgen
until we can get a proper fix into rustc.
