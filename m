That will work just fine, the api will allow that, just give each device
a unique name and you are good to go.

Then the virtual bus logic will have to create some sort of number/name
system and I don't want to do that.  It's a "first caller gets the name"
type thing here.  You can easily in a driver do this:

	my_dev_1 = virtual_device_create(&my_virt_ops, "my_dev_1");
	my_dev_2 = virtual_device_create(&my_virt_ops, "my_dev_2");
	my_dev_3 = virtual_device_create(&my_virt_ops, "my_dev_3");
	...

You share the same callbacks, and that's all you really care about.  If
you want to hang sysfs files off of these things, I can make them take a
device_groups pointer as well, but let's keep it simple first.

Hah, I totally missed that.  Language is fun...

Nope, see above, the driver is created dynamically per device created,
but that has NOTHING to do with the caller of this api, this is all
internal housekeeping.

You will note that the caller knows nothing about a driver or anything
like that, all it does is provide some callbacks.

What would be a "default"?  If you don't care/want to do anything with
probe/remove, then yes, we can allow it to be set to NULL.

Actually looking at some of the places this can be replaced with, that
does make sense, I'll go make that change.

Ok.

Again, see above, and stop worrying about the traditional "driver" model
here, I took that away from you :)

No, I think it will work, let me do some replacements later today after
I get some other work done, I think it does make sense, don't doubt
yourself :)
