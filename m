We don't intend to directly expose C data structures to Rust code (outside the
kernel crate). Instead, we intend to provide wrappers that expose safe
interfaces even though the implementation may use unsafe blocks. So we expect
the vast majority of Rust code to just care about the Rust memory model.

We admittedly don't have a huge number of wrappers yet, but we do have enough to
implement most of Binder and so far it's been ok. We do intend to eventually
cover other classes of drivers that may unveil unforeseen difficulties, we'll
see.

If you have concerns that we might have overlooked, we'd be happy to hear about
them from you (or anyone else).

Are you stating [what you perceive as] a fact or just venting? If the former,
would you mind enlightening us with some evidence?

There are advantages to adopting the preferred style of a language (when one
exists). We, of course, are not required to adopt it but I am of the opinion
that we should have good reasons to diverge if that's our choice in the end.

"Not having parentheses around the if-clause expression is complete rubbish"
doesn't sound like a good reason to me.
