I'm pretty convinced that #[should_panic] should fail for anything other
than a deliberate panic!() (including panic!() implemented via an
assertion). Another failure (be it BUG(), an invalid memory access,
etc.) feels like a separate thing. The example I'd give is a test which
is deliberately trying to trigger a panic!() or assert!() to verify
that, e.g., an invalid input/state is caught: if the code tried to
handle the invalid state and crashed, that shouldn't be a pass.


For assert!(false), while I personally don't like that this will cause a
test to pass -- it feels confusing to me -- I'm okay with having this
work for compatibility with upstream Rust.

How about:
- If #[should_panic] is set, we don't override assert!()/assert_eq!():
instead of getting compiled down to a KUnit assertion, they use the core
implementation which will panic!() on failure, and get caught by the
panic_handler. This should match upstream Rust behaviour (because it is
upstream Rust behaviour), and avoid having to plumb a bunch of
should_panic things through the C assert macro implementations.
- If a test really wants a KUnit assertion, the option of using
kernel::kunit_assert!() is there, which will behave like the C
assertions: a failed assertion will cause the test to fail. Of course, I
don't think we need to implement this until someone actually needs it.

Yeah, I'm hesitant to do something which involves either a lot of
plumbing in C, or a significant difference in behaviour between tests
written in C and Rust unless we've got a real use-case here.

Disabling the assert{,_eq}!() overrides for tests with #[should_panic]
seems to be the appropriate compromise to me, though.
