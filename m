Sounds good.

Perfect. Thanks.  There are a lot of little things like this that we
don't document well on the C side of things.  Big advantage of your
work is it'll help us clean some of that up.

Ah.  This is my lack of rust knowledge (and forgetfulness).  I'd avoid
putting too many comments in for the benefit of folk like me who are
still failing to find the time to learn rust :(
