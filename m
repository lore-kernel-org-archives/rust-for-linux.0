That only works because the parent can be recognized and properly
enumerated, so it is parent-relative.

With the help of a quirk though.

So this is kind of a valid use case, but since you don't need it any
more, I'd rather not put it in without a clear need.

Also, it's not a huge deal for a vendor to allocate a proper ACPI
device ID for a piece of hardware.  It just involves some due
diligence.
