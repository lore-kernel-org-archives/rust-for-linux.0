I think the idea is to avoid bugs as in the mhz19b driver [1].

This driver's probe() looks like this:


	serdev_device_set_client_ops(serdev, &mhz19b_ops);
	ret =3D devm_serdev_device_open(dev, serdev);

	// Lots of other initialization.

	serdev_device_set_drvdata(serdev, indio_dev);

But the receive_buf() callback from mhz19b_ops dereferences the driver's pr=
ivate
data.

Now, maybe this is actually prevented to become an actual race, since some
regulator is only enabled subsequently:

	devm_regulator_get_enable(dev, "vin");

But in any case in Rust it would be unsound as with this a driver could eas=
ily
cause undefined behavior with safe APIs.

Maybe it is as simple as letting the abstraction call serdev_device_open() =
only
after the driver's probe() has completed, but maybe there are reasons why t=
hat
is not an option, that's a serdev question.
