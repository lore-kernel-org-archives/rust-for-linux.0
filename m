I came to the same conclusion following the discussion around the firewire =
oops.

> You document it as being about consistent locking

It happens that quite a few busses rely on this, and there is a possible ra=
ce
condition that can lead to UAF bugs in the context of driver_override.

I think it is rather unlikely to happen though, as it would require a user =
to
change a device's driver_override field through sysfs while the device is
matched with a driver.

In any case, this can easily be solved with a separate lock.

Yes, the problem is that when a device is already present in the system and=
 a
driver is registered on the same bus, we iterate over all devices registere=
d on
this bus to see if one of them matches. If we come across an already bound =
one
where the corresponding driver crashed while holding the device lock (e.g. =
in
probe()) we can't make any progress anymore.

Obviously, this is not an issue the other way around, i.e. when the driver =
is
present in the system first and the device is added subsequently.

I agree, it is a case that will happen regularly, and besides hurting devel=
oper
ergonomics, it potentially decreases chances of shutting things down cleanl=
y and
obtaining logs in a production environment as well.

Yes, I agree and in fact I already have a few local changes to move
driver_override to struct device, provide corresponding accessors for busse=
s and
handle locking with a separate lock.

(Technically, the "move driver_override to struct device" part is orthogona=
l,
but doing it right away results in less (and much cleaner) changes.)

I do not consider those changes to be complicated and risky, but I'm not su=
re
you want to see those for one of the upcoming -rc releases (probably -rc4/5=
).

Independently, I can send a revert for -rc3.

Thanks,
Danilo
