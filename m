Sure, I can expand the cover letter in the next version to include
this. I linked to your original request, which gives the reader some
more background, but you're right, it doesn't hurt to mention it here
as well.

These patch sets are fully independent, but they are both needed
before we can support Rust. I'll clarify this too.

Ack.

I think the first patch is the only one that matches your description,
but it's only needed for the gendwarfksyms tool we're adding, so I'm
not sure it makes sense to merge it separately. I did have a couple of
other patches in previous versions that would qualify, but they've
been merged to -rc2 already.

Then the build fails. We used to check for libelf (part of elfutils
like libdw) in Makefile before, but Masahiro explained in commit
0d989ac2c90b ("kbuild: remove libelf checks from top Makefile") why
it's not necessary to have separate checks for the library
dependencies:

Thanks for the links, I'll take a look and see what tests it makes sense to=
 add.
