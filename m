Ok, I think you have me convinced. Mainly because `Page` as it is has no
benefit of exclusive access.

With alignment on `Page: AlwaysRefCounted`, I think this becomes
orthogonal. When we want to support allocations of more than one page,
we should probably make them compound pages (folios) and manage them
with the refcount (put_page), rather than non-compound high-order pages.
But this can wait.

I agree.

I see.

So for v21 I will implement RefCounted + AlwaysRefCounted for Page and
drop the Ownable implementation, have alloc_page() return ARef<Page>,
keep vm_insert_page() taking &Page, and switch Rust Binder to hold
ARef<Page>.

I will also include the SafePage/ExclusivePage series [1] in v21 as a user
of `Ownable` with a few modifications. It will no longer be possible for
this type to deref to `&Page`, due to `Page: AlwaysRefCounted` and
`vm_insert_page` taking refcounts through `&Page`.
