The problem with those is not that they must strictly be called before
allocating DMA memory, but they must not be called concurrently with other =
DMA
operations, such as allocating DMA memory, as it would technically be a dat=
a
race.

Now, we can't really have drivers define them statically (e.g. in the drive=
r
trait) as there may be cases where it depends on the runtime state or prope=
rties
of the device queried at runtime. Sometimes it is also defined through OF
properties (which from a kernel perspective are runtime values too).

For the same reason it is also pretty hard to invent a type state pattern f=
or
those setters that is not getting ridiculously complex without much value, =
which
is why we just kept them unsafe for the time being.

The best option to get rid of the unsafe would probably be to use atomics
instead. It would however be a rather big change, what makes it a bit of a =
hard
sell, given that the reason of this unsafe is more on the theoretical side =
of
things.

Theoretically, we could also optimize the situation for when it is statical=
ly
known, e.g. some dma::Config trait that can be implemented, such that the b=
us
can set the before calling probe(). But we'd really want this to work per d=
evice
ID table entry, as it may differ between supported devices. But that might =
not
be quite straight forward without associated_type_defaults. The simplest th=
ing I
could think of is some callback, such as

	fn dma_info(id_info: Option<&Self::IdInfo>) -> DmaInfo

which is called before probe(), but that's not great either. Maybe there is=
 a
good solution for this, but I'd first want to exhaust getting the setters s=
afe.
