I said that both are fine for now, just Result or the slice, but only the s=
ize
doesn't serve a purpose (see [1] above or the reasoning below).

There's nothing we can do about this, the file could also be corrupted, etc=
. In
the end there are only two cases, the hardware can't deal with garbage, the=
n the
size-sanity check is not sufficient and we need proper validation (e.g. thr=
ough
the returned slice), or the hardware can deal with garbage, then the size-s=
anity
check isn't necessary.

This is true, with the current approach we need something like

	let buf =3D VBox::<[u8; SIZE]>::zeroed(GFP_KERNEL)?;

which isn't the end of the world, especially in the firmware loading path, =
but I
agree it is a bit unfortunate.

We could indeed get rid of the initialization requirement entirely, but in =
this
case just returning a slice isn't sufficient, as it leaves the caller with =
e.g.
a VBox<MaybeUninit<[u8; SIZE]>> for storage, which is annoying if you want =
to
access the buffer subsequently, e.g. to parse headers, etc.

So, for this to properly work, you'd need to take the container (Vec, Box,
CoherentBox) by value and return the initialized one on success and the
uninitialized one wrapped into a custom error type on failure. But this is
probably a bit overengineered.

A simpler option would be to just use an initializer, such that
request_into_buf() becomes something like this:

	pub fn request_firmware_init<'a>(
	    name: &'a CStr,
	    dev: &'a Device,
	) -> impl Init<[u8], Error> + 'a {
	    unsafe {
	        init_from_closure(move |slot: *mut [u8]| {
	            // call request_firmware_into_buf()
	            Ok(())
	        })
	    }
	}

And then allocate the buffer with

	let init =3D request_firmware_init(...);
	let fw =3D VVec::init_with(len, init, GFP_KERNEL)?;

In any case, the current approach is fine for this series, this can be a
follow-up if needed.

The only thing that'd be nice to replace would be

	VVec::from_elem(0u8, size, GFP_KERNEL)

with

	VVec::<u8>::zeroed(size, GFP_KERNEL)

analogous to Box::zeroed().
