Thank you for this patch series!  Yes, I'm interested in Rust, though I didn't
have sufficient time to dig in yet.  I'm planning to attend Rust for Linux
training day [1] on next Sunday.

TLDR: I feel like we might need to wait or focus on module parameter support in
Rust, ongoing DAMON extension works before adopting Rust in DAMON.  Also, I'd
suggest starting with wsse, which is simpler.

I'd suggest starting from porting wsse, because it is simplest.  By scoping
down to it, you could drop the wrappers for DAMOS.

Do we have a timeline for module parameters support in Rust?  I'd prefer to
avoid use of debugfs and directly start with sysfs.

As I abovely mentioned, I'd prefer porting wsse first, and later extend to
DAMOS-based samples like prcl and mtier.

I think that's a good plan.  However, I'd like to call out we will also need to
make each step with good and sufficient discussions.  That is, for each step,
we will discuss if the previous step change was helpful and therefore make
sense to proceed to the next step.  If the conclusion is oppostie, we could
even revert the previous changes.  It would be great if we could make it driven
by data.

I think I should at least review the patches.  Also I feel I am responsible to
the maintenance of the code.

We are extending DAMON to work for not only data access but general data
attributes.  I'm also planning to refactor DAMON API quite a lot in near
future.  Some interfaces will be added and removed.  DAMON API callers
including sample modules would also need to be changed a lot.  If we make the
Rust sample module with the current API, we may need to make changes not only
in C but also Rust parts.  I concern if it can introduce more breakages that
require unnecessarily long time to fix.  Among all, my lack of Rust
understanding is a big concern.

I understand this patch series is a kind of experiment rather than for a real
use case that has a hard deadline.  If I'm not incorrect, I feel like this
might not be the best time to start the experiment.  Could we wait until
fundamental parts including module parameters support in Rust and ongoing DAMON
reconstruction, or my learning of Rust are done and stabilized?

I may missing many things.  I might simply rejecting this great opportunity
only due to my laziness.  Please push back if you find so.
