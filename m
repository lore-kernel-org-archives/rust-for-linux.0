iommu-pages.h looks like a private API internal to drivers/iommu. Is
there a plan to move that out so it can be used by non-iommu drivers?

If you think I should just use kmalloc, then I guess I could literally
just use KBox<PageTable> where PageTable is just a wrapper around [u64;
PTES_PER_PAGE] with an alignment attribute, or something like that. I
guess then just virt_to_phys() and back for the PTEs? So we still need
to add at least trivial wrappers to export those for Rust drivers to use.

I still need to be able to grab pointers to leaf pages for the crashdump
page table walker code though, and I want to keep the pfn and memory
type checks to make sure it won't crash trying to dereference the page
contents. So we also still need those too.

I'm not entirely sure what a higher-level Rust abstraction for this
looks like at this point, or whether it makes sense at all instead of
just trivially wrapping the C helpers... I don't particularly mind just
writing this part of the driver code "like C" (it's pretty much the
lowest-level bit of code in the driver anyway) but I guess we have to do
some thinking here.

Maybe this is one of those cases where we just do it ad-hoc for now, and
wait until a second driver that needs to implement page tables comes
around and we figure out what can be shared then, and what the API
should look like.

Hmm, starting to think maybe these should literally be impls on the
address types (PhysicalAddr::to_pfn(), PhysicalAddr::to_virt(), etc.).
Though that won't work without newtyping everything, but maybe we should?
