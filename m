Yes that is / was broken. Having the wrong fctx would cause wrong
container_of() calls and therefore explode.

Fixed it locally following your suggestion of creating fences on the
allocation object.

I tried to make it clear with the comment above:

        // To guarantee that an API caller can 100% rely on the signalling =
being
        // completed (i.e., all fence callbacks ran), we have to take the l=
ock.
        //
        // The reason is that the C dma_fence backend currently does not ca=
refully
        // synchronize the `dma_fence_is_signaled()` function with the prop=
er
        // spinlock. This can lead to the function returning `true` while f=
ence
        // callbacks are still being executed. This can be mitigated by gua=
rding
        // the entire function with the spinlock.
        //
        // See commit c8a5d5ea3ba6a.


I can try to make it more explicit.

Actually, I suppose with our design in Rust we would not actually need
this lock-unlock, because we ensure that it does not matter whether a
callback already ran.

But since we don't know who will be working on this in 5 years, adding
this or that exotic callback, or maybe registering callbacks on his own
fence, I put this sequence there for robustness.

So if the function returns true, you really know that all callbacks are
gone forever.
