Changes in v5:
  - Add back the Revocable<JobQueueInner…> from my earliest RFCs. Reason
    is still the same: JQ dropping while dependency fences signal could
    deadlock. Similarly, this solves a dependency kicking of the work
    item again while drop() is running.
  - Do not call run_job() with a lock held, since run_job() might sleep.
    AFAICS, this also makes the proposed XArray solution impossible and
    demands that we use a list.
  - Re-add the earlier credit-count-system, so that run_job() is
    infallible. Simplifies the design quite a bit. (Danilo)
  - Drop jobs in a deferred manner through the work item so that job
    payload data can do atomic-hostile stuff.
  - Because of the point above, I suggest that we stop dropping a
    DriverFence on signal (Danilo's and my idea). It has no real
    advantage, and getting rid of it allows for better controlling what
    drops when through JobQueue. For fence it's only relevant that there
    is an RCU grace period, thus:
  - Replace DriverFence::drop()'s call_rcu() with synchronize_rcu(). We
    would, therefore, demand that everyone who's got a problem with the
    delay drops via work item.

This can still not be tested as I'm blocked by pin-init vs self-ref.
Just FYI.

I would appreciate confirmation of these following thoughts on locking
design:

1.
I believe that callers of jq.new_job() and jq.submit_job() do not need
an outer serialization mutex. Reason is that JQ serializes with its
internal lock. Sequence numbers cannot take over older seqnos because it
is submit_job() who sets the seqno.

2.
I, furthermore, believe that a driver will not need to hold a
driver-lock while calling jq.complete_jobs_up_to_seqno().

IOW, I am suggesting that a driver can always safely use JQ without an
outer lock, and actually *should* do so to avoid potential locking
issues.

Reason:

let driver_stuff = foo.lock();
let current_gpu_seqno = driver_stuff.get_seqno();
drop(driver_stuff);
jq.complete_jobs_up_to_seqno(current_gpu_seqno);

Thus, I believe that it is OK for me to take the JQ lock in
jq.complete_jobs_up_to_seqno().

Please correct me if I'm missing something.

Should I be wrong and a lock inversion could occur, then we could
hypothetically add a fence Signaler object, with which we could signal
fences with a different lock. Similar to how drm_sched does it with the
hardware_fence.

P.


====

Cover letter from v4:

As the commit messages and code comments detail, progressing JobQueue is
currently somewhat blocked because of an issue with self-referential
PinInit, which Gary generously offered to investigate.

This code compiles, but the example does not because of the
aformentioned issue. Nevertheless, I wanted to provide another RFC here
so that we can move our discussions forward in the meantime, especially
since very much about JobQueue has changed.

Our, now upstreamed, DmaFence abstractions informed some of the notable
changes in JobQueue. Most notably, JobQueue now owns the FenceContext,
Jobs are created on the queue and own the DriverFence. Jobs, again, are
owned by the JobQueue. We hope to enforce correct behavior that way,
having FenceContext, JobQueue and firmware ring all correspond with each
other 1:1:1.

I suspect that a potential deadlock on JQ drop still exists. I
previously solved that with Revocable, which I tend to think will also
be the way to go here.

(One very great news btw is that we almost magically solved a number of
issues with the new DmaFence design – in combination with this JobQueue
design, for the first time it would be possible to fully support the
dma_fence backend_ops. The driver-unload-problem previously had most
users use intermediate fences, like the drm_sched_fence, which means
that callbacks, e.g. from userspace, could not be passed through to the
driver. Now, with FenceContextOps <-> JobQueueOps, we can theoretically
support all of them)

The differences between this draft and Daniel / Tyr's prototype which
probably are most noteworthy are the different lock design
("Philipp"-JobQueue has one big lock, wheres Tyr-JobQueue has 2, 3 if
you count the XArray lock) and the used data structure.

The presented solution uses lists over XArray because:
  1. XArray is semantically more complex and has an additional lock.
  2. An Xarray-as-ringbuffer needs own algorithms for index tracking,
     wrapp around etc. With list you enqueue into a waiting list, and
     for running you move into the running_list.
  3. The memory reservations we need for pre-allocating everything for
     our job-submission path are solved in one go with list, because a
     job simply contains a list head.
  4. Most notably, it is unclear how XArray behaves for ever-increasing
     indices with a sliding window, whereas the list semantic is well
     understood and deterministic.

I obviously don't claim to own all the wisdom in that regard; it's just
that I still propose this solution because these arguments make me
believe that it is the right one.

Since all the list handling is done with iterators, there is currently
no unsafe needed.


I hope we can discuss many things here before we, hopefully soon, can
address the lifetime issue and move to a v1.


This is based on drm-rust-next (10a6623a24a8), plus Danilo's ScopedWork
[1] and my patches [2][3] regarding 'static and lock errors.

Philipp
