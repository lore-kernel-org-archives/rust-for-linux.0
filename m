Yeah not sure on the details :)

Ack that's fair enough, will drop the doc update.

try-run is defined in scripts/Makefile.compiler which is only included ~200
lines after KGZIP is set.

That'll also set up and tear down a temp dir for a probe that doesn't need
that, so I think it's fine as it is.

The only place where it's invoked is vmlinux.bin at the end of the serial
tail, where all the tokens would be free anyway.

So I don't think it really buys anything at all?

Using jobserver-exec would also put python3 and two wrapper scripts in
front of every gzip in the build including tar -I "$(KGZIP)" when packaging
and some arm and m68k scripts too.

(For the module zips it's already constrained to a single process.)

Overall I think it's less complexity and really no delta to just invoke it
as normal.

It's designed as drop-in so it makes sense to use it as that.

Definitely not something for this series, the fallback is one invocation of
command -v and I don't really want to break RHEL either :)

If, once this has landed, we want to go that way then it's simple enough
for us to change it.

This is already achieved for the modinst case with a one-liner in any case.
