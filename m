A timestamp?  What does that do?
There is a lot of detail in your cover letter, but I think there is a
lot missing too.  I would like to understand how DEPT works, but I don't
want to dig too hard.  The document in patch 25/40 helps a bit, but it
is still a bit vague.
Where is the document which would explain at a level that would help me
understand this timestamp?

I disagree.
The "essence" of deadlock detection involves the interplay of ownership
and waiting.
In your cover letter "THE DEPT APPROACH" talks about [S] where and
event context begins, and [E] where the even occurs.  This S-E section
is exactly ownership.  During that time something "owns" the event.
Maybe the terminology is different, but the concept is the same.

I am sure.  Dependencies are between waiters and owners.

A strong theme in your cover letter is the need to add comprehensive
annotation for DEPT to work.
My position is that most of what we need for LOCKDEP to be able to
detect exactly the same things is appropriate annotation.
We need to annotate when ownership is handed off to another thread, and
when the other thread takes on ownership.

So what does your scheme provide that is clearly better?  Is the
annotation easier?  Is some of it automatic?  Does if give better error
reports?=20

I had a look through dept.rst and it seems that if a lock is released by
a different thread than the one which took the lock, then DEPT can
detect that and do something useful.  That might be interesting.
But how does it know when it first took ownership of that lock?  Or you
use your terminology: how does it know when that lock first entered the
context in that thread?

Maybe when you see an "unlock", you assume the lock has been owned since
the last time the context didn't hold hold any locks.  Would that be
right?=20
Surely it wouldn't the too hard to teach lockdep about that.
i.e.  when a lock, which is allowed to migrate across threads, is
released though it wasn't held - insert this lock at the top of the
current context and re-assess all the wait points.

How do you decide that a lock that was taken is no longer part of the
current context?
