Well, it is two ioctls for a structured set of properties, whereas GETPARAM=
 is N
ioctls with no structure and slightly less type information.

Note that there's no need to grow existing info groups endlessly; if someth=
ing
truly becomes a separate concern we can just add a new group, e.g.
DRM_NOVA_MEMORY_INFO.

This is equally true of GETPARAM; we accumulate keys that nobody uses anymo=
re.

Allocating for one or two deprecated fields for a single query doesn't seem=
 like
a big deal; plus we can always create a new info group and leave the old on=
e
alone, just like a deprecated GETPARAM key.

I don't think sysfs is a good fit; it seems tedious for a UMD to do a bunch=
 of
sysfs file reads, each of them requiring at least three syscalls. Plus the
effort to parse the value from the string sysfs provides, which is more err=
or
prone than reading a typed struct.
