Subject: [PATCH v3 1/2] rust: std_vendor: add `likely()`, `unlikely()` and `cold_path()`
Date: Fri, 16 Oct 2026 18:24:45 +0200

`{un,}likely()` are commonly used macros on the C side -- there are
more than 25k occurrences in the tree. Rust is likely going to provide
functions (not macros) for the same purpose: `core::hint::{un,}likely()`.
Currently they are unstable under `feature(likely_unlikely)` [1].

For instance, given:

    fn f1(a: i32) -> i32 {
        if a < 0 {
            return 123;
        }

        42
    }

    fn f2(a: i32) -> i32 {
        if likely(a < 0) {
            return 124;
        }

        42
    }

    fn f3(a: i32) -> i32 {
        if unlikely(a < 0) {
            return 125;
        }

        42
    }

LLVM emits code equivalent to the one it would for similar C functions:

    f1:
            test   %edi,%edi
            mov    $0x7b,%ecx
            mov    $0x2a,%eax
            cmovs  %ecx,%eax
            ret

    f2:
            mov    $0x7c,%eax
            test   %edi,%edi
        /-- jns    <f2+0xa>
        |   ret
        \-> mov    $0x2a,%eax
            ret

    f3:
            mov    $0x2a,%eax
            test   %edi,%edi
        /-- js     <f3+0xa>
        |   ret
        \-> mov    $0x7d,%eax
            ret

Thus vendor (essentially) the `core` library code to provide the same
API (so that we may use `core`'s directly in the future).

We do so by implementing `{un,}likely()` like `core`'s `intrinsics` do
(to save a layer) and based on calling our own `cold_path()` instead of
using `core`'s (which is stable since 1.95.0 [2][3]).

It turns out that simply using `#[cold]` to emulate `cold_path()`,
suggested by Gary [4], works in the cases I tested across all supported
versions so far, so we can avoid the complexity of having one more Kconfig
and conditionally enabling the feature in callers (since `cold_path()`
was added in Rust 1.86.0 [5]).

We could optionally call `cold_path()` for Rust >= 1.86.0 within our own
`cold_path()`, but it seems that it is not needed, and anyway since Rust
1.98.0 `cold_path()` is itself `#[cold]` so that it works even if the
MIR inliner can't inline it [6].

Even if we find that it is not optimal in some cases, it can be improved,
and meanwhile we will have the means to annotate these cases already.

Apart from that, the only differences with `core`'s version are the
usual changes (`pr_*!` calls and their `\n`, imports, attributes, lint
cleanup), plus a fix for a polarity typo (I sent a fix upstream [7])
and removal of unneeded code documentation.

In addition, add them to the prelude (inlined, so that the documentation
is rendered at least there, until we can use `core`'s).

v3: I used Gary's `#[cold]` suggestion, and thus removed the Kconfig.
I rebased and made sure the code is up to date with `core`, tested a
bunch of things, compared again with C and the assembly generated, found
a strange behavior on Clang I will report separately, a polarity typo in
`core` (fixed here) and inlined the docs in the prelude to get it
rendered somewhere until we bump the MSRV. I think the potential issue
I found in v2's discussion may have been with `-Os`, but it happens the
same way with `core`'s, so it does not matter.

Alice, Gary: I removed your Reviewed-by's just in case. It is pretty
similar to last time, but the commit message is reworded, and the commit
is simpler.
