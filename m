Which is the standard for many core APIs, such as [1]. However, I do agree =
that
in this case the correct fix would be to have all architectures provide the
stubs rather than the Rust code.

However, there's already a precedent for this in the kernel, e.g. in [2]. O=
f
course, it would be better to clean this up, but depending on whether there=
's
more architectures having this issue (I didn't check) that's separate from =
a
fix.

As mentioned, I didn't check, but if this is the only architecture causing =
those
issues that'd be the better fix of course.

However, IIUC, your patch below would make ioremap() and friends silenty su=
cceed
and only the accessors would prevent undefined behavior?

In this case I still think ioremap() should just fail.
