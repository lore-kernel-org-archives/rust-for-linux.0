 Obviously I can't speak for the s390, but that's been my observation as 
well -- it is a matter of coding style then rather than HAS_IOMEM being 
inherently PCI/ISA.

 On DECstation we actually have driver code shared between TURBOchannel 
peripheral bus and PCI (and possibly EISA) and it obviously uses the 
standard MMIO accessors consistently regardless of the bus binding.

 Then there is code shared between TURBOchannel and platform stuff, also 
with the system models that lack a peripheral bus too.  There is leftover 
code using non-standard accessors still there, but that's really a matter 
of resources needed to clean this up.

 For instance drivers/net/ethernet/amd/declance.c has now been high on my 
priority list to clean up and properly convert from its current mess to a 
regular TURBOchannel/platform device.  The only issue outstanding are MMIO 
barriers, which have never been properly sorted out in a generic way; cf. 
arch/mips/include/asm/io.h and the iobarrier_*() stuff there.
