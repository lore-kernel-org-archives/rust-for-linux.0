I think this section on soundness could be more clear. You never
really give a definition for what soundness is; you just jump into an
example immediately.

It may be nice to talk about how a sound API must prevent memory
safety issues, even if the safe code required to do so is silly or
unrealistic. Doing so is necessary to maintain the "safe code never
has memory safety bugs" guarantee.

I would love to see a proper example here.

I think it is worth explicitly pointing out that the safety comment
must explain why the preconditions are satisfied, *not* what the
preconditions are. It's a really really common mistake to mix up
these, and it probably even makes sense to include two examples
showing the difference.

It would be nice with an example of a completely normal safety comment
example. Also would be nice to call out that the semicolon goes
outside the unsafe block to improve formatting, when it's a single
operation.

It would also be nice with an example that shows how to reference the
safety requirements of the current function. (That is, an example that
combines unsafe fn with unsafe block.)
