Indeed, but please note that this was the case before as well. When we had
`device::Data` with a `Revokable<T>` for Registrations this revokable was
revoked through the `DeviceRemoval` trait when the driver was unbound from the
device.

If there is no bus, device or driver, then those abstractions aren't for your
use case. Those are abstractions around the device / driver core.

That seems to be purely a design question for cpufreq drivers then.

What prevents you from always creating a corresponding platform device?

If you really want some drivers to bypass the device / driver model (not sure
if that's a good idea though), you need separate abstractions for that.

That doesn't help you either. As mentioned above, `device::Data` was supposed to
receive a callback (`DeviceRemoval`) from the underlying driver (platform_driver
in your case) on device detach to revoke the registration.

By using `Devres` instead, nothing changes semantically, but it makes the
resulting code cleaner.

> What else can be done ?

Think about what you want the lifetime of your cpufreq registration to be.

Currently, it seems you want to do both, bind it to probe() / remove(), in case
the driver is implemented as platform_driver, and to module_init() /
module_exit(), in case the device / driver model is bypassed.
