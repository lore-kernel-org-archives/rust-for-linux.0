The implication if leaked is the same as if it is kept alive past driver un=
bind,
which is why I changed the TODO comment accordingly in the hunk below.

If you look for a specific example, there's [1] for instance. So, it is
problematic, which is why I added the TODO comment back then.

But, we did accept this soundness hole from the get-go for both, keeping a
coherent allocation alive beyond driver unbind and for leaking it.

With this patch it is now impossible to keep it alive beyond driver unbind,=
 so
switching to unsafe now would be a bit odd. :)

(The fact that we did accept this for coherent allocations is also one reas=
on
why I was recently arguing that we can also make the forget() issue an acce=
pted
soundness hole for registrations.)
