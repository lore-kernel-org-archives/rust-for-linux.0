I think that there are two things we're trying to implement correctly:

1) Deny access to a subset of the state while a reset is in progress
2) Wait for anyone accessing 1) to finish before starting a reset

IIUC, using Atomic<T> can solve 1 by bailing if the "reset in progress"
flag/variant is set, but I don't think it implements 2? One would have =
to
implement more logic to block until the state is not being actively =
used.

Now, there are probably easier ways to solve this, but I propose that we =
do the
extra legwork to make this explicit and enforceable by the type system.

How about introducing a r/w semaphore abstraction? It seems to correctly =
encode
the logic we want:

a) multiple users can access the state if no reset is pending ("read" =
side)
b) the reset code can block until the state is no longer being accessed =
(the "write" side)

In Tyr, this would roughly map to something like:

struct TyrData {
  reset_gate: RwSem<ActiveHwState>
  // other, always accessible members
}

impl TyrData {
  fn try_access(&self) -> Option<ReadGuard<'_, ActiveHwState>> {...}
}

Where ActiveHwState contains the fw/mmu/sched blocks (these are not =
upstream
yet, Deborah has a series that will introduce the fw block that should =
land
soon) and perhaps more.

Now, the reset logic would be roughly:

fn reset_work(tdev: Arc<TyrDevice>) {
  // Block until nobody else is accessing the hw, prevent others from
  // initiating new accesses too..
  let _guard =3D tdev.reset_gate.write();
  =20
  // pre_reset() all Resettable implementors

  ... reset

  // post_Reset all Resettable implementors
}

Now, for every block that might touch a resource that would be =
unavailable
during a reset, we enforce a try_access() via the type system, and =
ensure that
the reset cannot start while the guard is alive. In particular, ioctls =
would
look like:

fn ioctl_foo(...) {
  let hw =3D tdev.reset_gate.try_access()?;
  // resets are blocked while the guard is alive, no other way to access =
that state otherwise
}

The code will not compile otherwise, so long as we keep the state in =
ActiveHwState, i.e.:=20
protected by the r/w sem.

This looks like an improvement over Panthor, since Panthor relies on =
manually
canceling work that access hw state via cancel_work_sync(), and gating =
new work
submissions on the "reset_in_progress" flag, i.e.:

/**
 * sched_queue_work() - Queue a scheduler work.
 * @sched: Scheduler object.
 * @wname: Work name.
 *
 * Conditionally queues a scheduler work if no reset is =
pending/in-progress.
 */
#define sched_queue_work(sched, wname) \
do { \
if (!atomic_read(&(sched)->reset.in_progress) && \
    !panthor_device_reset_is_pending((sched)->ptdev)) \
queue_work((sched)->wq, &(sched)->wname ## _work); \
} while (0)


Thoughts?
