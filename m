Ok, but again, that is going to cause all sorts of "the symbol is
undefined" type of problems going forward as a developers just "assumes"
that the place where the symbol is exported will actually have the
symbol exported from it, not that this place will be copied inline into
somewhere else.

Think about the interaction between module symbol namespaces here.  This
isn't going to scale, and will trip people up and cause us to be forced
to export way more than we really want to (like this patch series shows,
I don't want to export any of these...)
