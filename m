The reason KUNIT_FAULT_TEST was user-configurable is that some test 
harnesses / CI systems would automatically mark a test failed if they 
saw a panic/WARN stacktrace in the kernel output.

Yeah, I really don't like the way this effectively reverses what 
assert!() does. I'm sort-of okay with it in indirectly-called code (I 
want to check that this function panics if I pass an invalid input, and 
don't care whether it calls assert!() or panic!()), but it's really 
confusing from within the test function.

Plus there's a whole bunch of special-cased code to make kunit_assert!() 
behave this way in this patch, and if we could get rid of that, the 
whole thing would be much cleaner.

(Of course, that introduces an inconsistency depending on where the 
assert!() is, which isn't particularly nice, though I'd be prepared to 
tolerate it to make everything else behave as expected.)

I've always thought of CONFIG_KUNIT_FAULT_TEST as being a more general 
switch for tests which can cause faults, but the name and description to 
imply it's more of a switch for just those tests. I'm happy to keep 
CONFIG_KUNIT_FAULT_TEST as the generic implementation here, but if we 
really want another one, they both probably should chain off a single 
CONFIG_HAVE_KUNIT_FAULT_HANDLER or similar.

That being said, I'd prefer we go back to the panic_handler 
implementation for should_panic, as I think we're asking for trouble 
with Rust tests which deliberately panic in C code. Ideally, Rust tests 
will only trigger Rust panics deliberately. The panic_handler-based 
imeplementation works fine on UML.
