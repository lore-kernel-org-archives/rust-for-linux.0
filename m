:) Yeah, it's something that's annoyed me for a long time too.

Thanks, will have a read through those!

I do recommend trying them locally ;)

It makes a surprising difference to defconfig even. (Though you need pigz
installed for the full effect)

Thanks! :)

I made sure to audit everything it came up with patch-by-patch, got it to
rework the horrors then rewrote large chunks of what it came up with.

Sure, happy to drop anything like that.

Though based on what Miguel said it _might_ be ok perhaps with a nightly
gate on it? Will see what he/Bjorn say.

Agreed, it definitely needs some eyes on it, especially the trickier bits.

Yeah, it'd be nice to see this benefit everyone!

Am happy to iterate on it as needed to get it upstream.
