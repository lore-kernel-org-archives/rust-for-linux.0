Hi Ian, thanks for the v2,

Is there any mechanism in place that prevents libbpf, libelf, and libbfd
to link to different versions of zlib (zlib vs zlib-rs, I mean)? I
imagine you could have bpftool linking against zlib-rs, but the libs
installed on the system linking against zlib? Also I think the static
build with the LLVM disassembler [0] passes -lz -lzstd in LIBS and I'm
not sure how it would combine with the change, I need to take a closer look.

I understand you're transitioning to zlib-rs, but the current patch is
not a full transition, in the sense that it doesn't replace zlib with
zlib-rs but allows any of the two options; and I don't see support for
the standard zlib being removed from bpftool anytime soon, which means
that in practice, we've got to maintain compatibility with the two
versions going forward. Others may want to chime in, but I'm still not
convinced this is worth the burden.

You also mention zstd, do you plan to add support for a zstd alternative
as well in perf and bpftool in the future?

(By the way, if you allow me a short digression, you had a patch related
to the zstd probing for perf and bpftool [0] and I don't see in the
tree, do you know if it was ever merged?)

Best regards,
Quentin
