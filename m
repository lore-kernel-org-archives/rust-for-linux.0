Similar to DMA masks, the segment parameters should be set appropriately 
before any dma_map_sg() operation. Plus since they likely influence 
scatterlist geometry, that means typically they're also going to need to 
be set before building the scatterlist to be mapped in the first place.

I don't think there's any expectation that they would ever change 
*between* different mappings - especially given the underlying hardware 
properties they represent - so while that might technically be possible 
in the C API if the caller can enforce sufficient ordering, it should be 
fine to rule it out in the Rust abstraction if that makes things easier 
to reason about.

Thanks,
Robin.
