Hi SJ,

Thank you for the detailed reply.  Comments inline below.

Agreed, and after thinking it over I am fine with deferring the series.

For context, the original goal was never really the sample itself: what
I was hoping to start was a thin Rust compatibility layer for DAMON --
the damon.rs wrappers -- with prcl serving only as its first in-tree
user, to validate that the wrappers are usable so that others can build
their own DAMON-based modules on top of them.  It is therefore a bit
unfortunate that the first step ends up blocked partly by something
outside of DAMON, namely the lack of writable/sysfs-backed module
parameters in Rust.

That said, I understand the position and I do not think waiting is the
wrong outcome: the parameters have no committed timeline, and the DAMON
API reconstruction is actively changing the interfaces the wrappers
would sit on, so starting now with a debugfs-only interface we already
know we want to replace would just add churn to moving APIs.

I am not aware of one.  rust-next still registers Rust module
parameters with perm 0 (load-time only).  I will keep an eye on the
rust-for-linux list; if anyone picks it up, I would appreciate being
Cc'd.

Noted -- when this restarts, it will be the wsse-scoped version, without
the DAMOS wrappers, and the compatibility layer will grow around only
what that sample actually needs.

Yes.  I will park the patches and restart once both are true:

1. Rust supports writable/sysfs-backed module parameters.
2. the DAMON API reconstruction has settled enough that wrappers can
   target the new interfaces directly.

Meanwhile I will keep working on DAMON in C as usual.

Enjoy the training day, and good luck with the Rust learning.

Thanks,
