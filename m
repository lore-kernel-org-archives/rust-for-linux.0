The SCSI logic is the CDB encoding in scsi.rs and about 50 lines of
completion disposition in queue.rs (status to block status, unit
attention requeue). I agree that the latter is the start of what
scsi_decide_disposition and sd_done do, and that it is incomplete. What
I am not yet convinced of is that the complete version for UFS is large
or subtle compared to scsi midlayer combined with current ufshcd.

Correct, the RFC deliberately leaves out recovery and task management.
We wanted to get this discussion going sooner rather than later.

Of course we would validate the driver with proper testing before
declaring it stable.

And yes, the encoding/decoding surface will expand a bit once we
implement TMF and recovery. And there would have to be a bit of logic to
handle that as well. And that logic would be similar in semantics to
code in the scsi midlayer. I doubt it will be many lines, but I feel
like I have to build it first to convince you of that.

Agreed, and I did not read it as a criticism of the language.

For ub, the deprecation commit from 2012 says it was removed because
every device it handled was also handled by usb-storage. Not because the
SCSI midlayer turned out to be deep. The UFS situation is different. The
device population is a handful of vendors behind one host controller
spec.

If we expected this new driver to be a strict subset of ufshcd, we would
not build it. The reason to do it is the features that do not fit the
scsi midlayer.

Here is what I count the midlayer doing for UFS today: sense to
retry/errno disposition (scsi_decide_disposition, scsi_check_sense,
sd_done), the abort to LU reset to host reset escalation in scsi_eh with
ufshcd supplying the handlers, the sd device model (capacity, write
cache, UNMAP, runtime PM), and the SG_IO ioctl plus the scsi_device
sysfs tree. Which of these is the part you expect to take years?

Best regards,
Andreas Hindborg
