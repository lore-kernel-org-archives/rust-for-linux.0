This would be similar to

  let r1 = tagset.get(0)?;
  ler r2 = r1.clone();
  r1.end_ok();
  r2.do_something_requires_active();

but it is not a problem because we do not implement any actions that are
illegal in that position (outside of `end` - that _is_ a problem).

Because we want to assert that we are consuming the last handle to the
request. After we do that, the user cannot call `Request::end` again.
`TagSet::get` will not issue a request reference if the request is not
in flight. Although there might be a race condition to watch out for.

When the block layer hands over ownership to Rust, the reference count
is 1. The first `ARef<Request>` we create increments the count to 2. To
complete the request, we must have ownership of all reference counts
above 1. The block layer takes the last reference count when it takes
back ownership of the request.

Yes, that would require a custom smart pointer with a `try_into_unique`
method that succeeds when the refcount is exactly 2. It would consume
the instance and decrement the refcount to 1. But as I said, there is a
potential race with `TagSet::get` when the refcount is 1 that needs to
be handled.

I needs to change a little, yes.

It would not need to be exposed to the user, other than a) ending a request
can fail OR b) `TagSet::get` can fail.

a) would require that ending a request must be done with a unique
reference. This could be done by the user by the user calling
`try_into_unique` or by making the `end` method fallible.

b) would make the reference handle `!Clone` and add a failure mode to
`TagSet::get`, so it fails to construct a `Request` handle if there are
already one in existence.

I gravitate towards a) because it allows the user to clone the Request
reference without adding an additional `Arc`.
