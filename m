I'll give it a shot with these functions. If they work for my use case,
then it's good to have extra checks and I'll add them for v2. Thanks!

Under the hood it's shmem. For pinning, it winds up at
`drm_gem_get_pages()`, which I think does a `shmem_read_folio_gfp()` on
a mapping set as unevictable.

I'm not very familiar with the innards of that codepath, but it's
definitely an invariant that GEM objects have to be pinned while they
are mapped in GPU page tables (otherwise the GPU would end up accessing
freed memory).

Since the code that walks the PT to dump pages is part of the same PT
object and takes a mutable reference, the Rust guarantees mean it's
impossible for the PT to be concurrently mutated or anything like that.
So if one of these objects *were* unpinned/freed somehow while the dump
code is running, that would be a major bug somewhere else, since there
would be dangling PTEs left over.

In practice, there's a big lock around each PT/VM at a higher level of
the driver, so any attempts to unmap/free any of those objects will be
stuck waiting for the lock on the VM they are mapped into.

I don't have an explicit check for that here but yes, the pages wind up
marked PageReserved. This includes both no-map ranges and map ranges.
The no-map ranges also have a valid struct page if within the declared
RAM range but they would oops if we try to access the contents via
direct map, so the page_is_ram() check is there to reject those (and
MMIO and anything else that isn't normally mapped as RAM even if it
winds up with a struct page).

Right, that's why the safe API never does any of the weird pfn->page
stuff. Rust driver code has to use unsafe {} to access the raw pfn->page
interface, which requires a // SAFETY comment explaining why what it's
doing is safe, and then we need to document in the function signature
what the safety requirements are so those comments can be reviewed.

This is the common case for the page tables. 99% of the time this is
what the driver will be doing, with a single exception (the root page
table of the firmware/privileged VM is a system reserved memory region,
and falls under (b). It's one single page globally in the system.).

The driver actually uses the completely unchecked interface in this
case, since it knows the pfns are definitely OK. I do a single check
with the checked interface at probe time for that one special-case pfn
so it can fail gracefully instead of oops if the DT config is
unusable/wrong.

This only ever happens during firmware crash dumps (plus the one
exception above).

The missing (c) case is the kernel/firmware shared memory GEM objects
during crash dumps. But I really need those to diagnose firmware
crashes. Of course, I could dump them separately through other APIs in
principle, but that would complicate the crashdump code quite a bit
since I'd have to go through all the kernel GPU memory allocators and
dig out all their backing GEM objects and copy the memory through their
vmap (they are all vmapped, which is yet another reason in practice the
pages are pinned) and merge it into the coredump file. I also wouldn't
have easy direct access to the matching GPU PTEs if I do that (I store
the PTE permission/caching bits in the coredump file, since those are
actually kind of critical to diagnose exactly what happened, as caching
issues are one major cause of firmware problems). Since I need the page
table walker code to grab the firmware pages anyway, I hope I can avoid
having to go through a completely different codepath for the kernel GEM
objects...
