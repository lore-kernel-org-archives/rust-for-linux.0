I have given Alice's code a spin and concluded that it would be fully
usable for my intended use-case. The trick would then be to force users
of my API to pass their data in an RcuBox, which Rust can certainly
enforce. Has the great advantage of me not having to allocate again
just to drop something, so this is a far cleaner design.

From my side, only minor details would remain open regarding Alice's
draft, like Boqun's question about how to implement VBox maybe.

But in principle you can regard my patch here to be withdrawn :)
