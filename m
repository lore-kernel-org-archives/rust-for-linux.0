Ack, will fix in v3 to limit to only the --link run without --module, which
is how vmlinux.o is processed, leaves modules as they are.

I'm not sure that really gains us anything - at the point of doing the
vmlinux.o processing (which with the above change is all that is being done
now) everything's idle so the jobserver would just hand over the same 16
threads.

It'd need quite a bit of work to interact with it too with added complexity
+ some overhead so would have to check impact on perf here.

You did complain about added complexity also ;) if you insist I can try.

A rationale was provided:

	Threading is limited to decoding and the jump pass, so the gain
	flattens out at 16 threads and any further threads were found to
	only add overhead.

	When performing an allmodconfig build, the clang invocation of
	objtool when processing vmlinux.o took 5.93s on 1 thread, 4.56s on
	8, 4.51s on 16 and 4.63s on 128.

Let me know what you feel was missing there? These things inevitably have
to be somewhat heuristic.

The size threshold is about paying for too many threads for no real gain,
and now (for v3) the code is limited to a --link operation only, that'll
only really stop a tinyconfig vmlinux.o :)

Why? We shouldn't cap a 4 CPU box to 4 CPUs?

The idea is that the empirically obtained 16 core limit should naturally be
capped to the number of CPUs.

I guess in a world where make hands jobs off this could be dropped, though,
if the complexity there seems worthwhile.

I mean sashiko is hallucinating at a rate >50% on this series, so pinches
of salt all round :) I do think frontier models with a good amount of
checking + e.g. Chris Mason's review-prompts are helpful to rein in stuff.

Anyway I had mine check it ;) and I also have a beefy threadripper sitting
around for bounding reality on this stuff and it all came back clean:

	Those writes go to the thread's own instruction bytes and its own
	relocation, the only shared state touched is the section and elf
	"changed" flags, which every writer sets to true, and the mcount
	case for a sibling call is a warning path. The v2 sanitizer run
	used the gcc allmodconfig options, which lack
	--mcount/--mnop/--cfi/--fineibt, so I reran it on the clang
	allmodconfig vmlinux.o with its full option set: zero reports, the
	jump pass included.
